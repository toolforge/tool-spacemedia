"2022-snow-cover-area-alps-reached-minimum"	"The effects of the severe drought that has been gripping Northern Italy for months are becoming even more evident with the warmer temperatures and the approach of summer. In fact, according to the Centre d’Etudes Spatiales de la Biosphère (CESBIO – Centre for Space Studies of the Biosphere), after a winter characterised by a lack of rain, the 2022 snow cover area reached its minimum earlier than any other year since 2001. The residual snow cover, shown in red to distinguish it from clouds, is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 14 June 2022. The Snow and Ice Monitoring product provided by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) offers high-resolution near real-time data used to monitor snow cover area, snow state conditions, persistent snow area and ice cover."
"2022-united-nations-climate-change-conference-kick-sharm-el-sheikh"	"The 27th UN Climate Change Conference started on 6 November 2022. This edition is taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, in Egypt. On 27 October 2022, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this image of the COP27 host city and its surroundings. The venue of the UN Climate Change Conference is shown by the COP27 label. The Copernicus component of the EU Space Programme provides a wide range of products and services which are key for the formulation of policies aimed at the mitigation of and adaptation to the effects of climate change."
"68a-and-68c-antarctic-icebergs"	"After the calving from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017, the A-68A Antarctic iceberg drifted undisturbed in the Antarctic ocean until the end of April 2020 when it reached the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, near the South Orkney Islands, where it began to break up, spawning a new companion named A-68C. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites, shows the two icebergs on 17 May 2020: at the time of the acquisition, A-68A measured a little less than 5000 square kilometres (twice the surface of Luxembourg), A -68C about 150 square kilometres. RADAR data obtained by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites, are not influenced by the presence of clouds, or by polar seasonal long nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring drifting icebergs."
"a74-iceberg-after-calving-brunt-ice-shelf-antarctica"	"A giant iceberg, referenced as A74, with an area approximately 1.5 times as large as the one of Greater Paris, calved from the northern section of Antarctica’s Brunt Ice Shelf on 26 February 2021. After breaking free, it initially moved away rapidly from the floating ice shelf but its calving does not seem to pose a threat to the currently uninhabited British Antarctic Survey’s Halley VI Research Station, which was relocated in 2017 to a more secure location as the ice shelf was deemed unsafe. A74 is the result of multiple cracks that have been developing in the Brunt Ice Shelf, some over many years, some very recently. Its calving could possibly be the first in a series of breakaways in the coming days and weeks. This image, which has been acquired by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 5 March 2021, shows the A74 iceberg after its calving. It has not yet moved very far from where the break occurred more than a week ago. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) that are both equipped with a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument providing data that are not influenced by the presence of clouds, or by seasonal polar long nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring drifting icebergs."
"above-average-temperatures-antarctic-peninsula"	"Although many glaciers in Antarctica usually maintain their snow cover throughout the year, the last austral summer season saw anomalously high temperatures that resulted in the melting of several snow-covered regions in the Antarctic Peninsula, which extends towards South America, to their bare ground. Several glaciers in the region completely disappeared this season, and many others lost their snow cover. Periods with temperatures warmer than average began to affect the area in November and persisted until February, with several regions recording 15 to 20 more days of melting than usual. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 19 February 2023, shows Vega Island and its ice cap, with its eastern part entirely snowless. Open data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are crucial for monitoring glaciers worldwide."
"absence-ice-arch-nares-strait-2022-winter"	"Every winter, an ice arch appears in the Nares Strait, between Canada and Greenland. Ice arches are structures whose geometry prevents sea ice from exiting the Arctic Ocean and drifting south. Typically, ice arches break up in early July and reform the following winter. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, compare the status of the ice arch on 14 March 2021 and one year later, on 14 March 2022, showing that there is currently no ice arch in the Nares Strait. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellite missions allows to assess sea ice extent in the Arctic and Antarctic."
"absence-sea-ice-gulf-saint-lawrence-affecting-harp-seals-canada"	"These images, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 23 March 2020 and 28 March 2021, provide evidence of the absence of sea ice in 2021 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in Canada. Each winter, a population of harp seals travels to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence from the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. Around late February and early March, the harp seals nest on the sea ice around the archipelago of Magdalen Islands (Îles de la Madeleine), giving birth to a new generation of pups. In 2021, due to the record low level of the sea ice extent, the lowest since 1969, hundreds of newborn pups have been discovered on the beach just outside the small community of Blanc-Sablon in Québec, about 500 kilometres northeast of the Magdalen Islands. National Geographic reports that 2021 is expected to be a devastating year for this harp seal population, resulting in an enormous death toll for the pups that are left separated from their mothers amidst unstable ice floes and exposed to land predators, further threatening the survival of the entire species. Multispectral data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission can be a powerful tool for the retrieval of the biogeophysical parameters of sea ice in polar regions."
"absence-sea-ice-laptev-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on September 13, shows a view of a sea ice-free Laptev Sea. According to EUMETSAT data, at the end of August 2021, the Laptev sea saw the record-low sea ice extent for this time of year since 1980, the year in which the organisation started building its time series. In addition to supporting the biodiversity of fragile Arctic ecosystems, sea ice has an important role in the climate system. The absence of sea ice is, in fact, at the root of ""Arctic amplification"", the phenomenon that describes the faster warming of the Arctic compared to the rest of the world. Sea ice is one of the climate indicators studied and monitored by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Every month C3S releases a bulletin detailing the state of the climate in the world."
"absence-sea-ice-north-svalbard-november-2021"	"Every month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) publishes a Climate Bulletin which details the current status of the climate. This is developed using key Climate Indicators obtained from Copernicus Earth Observation data. Among the most noteworthy information in the latest bulletin (October 2021) is the fact that, globally, temperatures in October were 0.42°C warmer than the 1991-2020 average for the month. Moreover, the monthly extent of sea ice in the Arctic was 7% below average, the 9th lowest monthly extent in the 43-year satellite data record. This anomaly was particularly evident in the absence of sea ice north of the Svalbard Archipelago. Indeed, this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites, shows that sea ice was still absent north of Svalbard on 12 November 2021. C3S monitors 21 of the indicators used to assess how the climate is changing. All of these data can be found here."
"absence-sea-ice-south-svalbard-archipelago"	"This image, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite on 12 January 2023, provides evidence of the absence of sea ice south of the Svalbard archipelago. According to the climate bulletin issued by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, December 2022 was the seventh warmest December on record. Additionally, the Arctic Sea ice extent for December 2022 was 3% below average, ranking eighth lowest in the satellite record. One of the areas in which the lack of sea ice was particularly concerning is located south of the Svalbard Archipelago. Antarctic sea ice extent also reached its second-lowest value for December in the 44-year satellite dataset, at 13% below average. Additional information are available here."
"abundant-rains-senegal-after-six-years-drought"	"Senegal is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Recent years have been marked by erratic rainfall patterns which are increasing the rate of soil erosion, salinisation of agricultural soils and the destruction of critical infrastructure. But in 2020, after a six year-long period of drought, rains created the thickest vegetation in years giving a vital respite for Senegal’s farmers and its 3 million-strong herding community. The rains have also boosted other sectors: grains output is expected to jump over 30%, prompting Senegal to reverse its economic outlook for 2020 from contraction to growth. This comparison of two images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 A and Sentinel-2B satellites on 11 November 2019 (left) and 15 November 2020 (right), allows observing the larger presence of vegetation in 2020 in the Linguere region in Senegal. With a revisit time of 5 days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor droughts and their impact on the vegetation."
"aegean-waters-whitening-due-sunglint-and-strong-winds"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 June 2021, shows a particular colouration of the Aegean Sea as a result of sunglint and of strong winds. Sunglint is an optical phenomenon that occurs when sunlight reflects off the water's surface at the same angle as the satellite sensor is capturing the image. This phenomenon causes the water to appear in a pearly white colour, which contrasts with the usual deep blue of the sear. When Sentinel-2 acquired this image, in addition to the sunglint, the Aegean sea was also affected by winds coming from the north, which generated specific vortices in the water after hitting the Greek islands and made the sunglint phenomenon even more visible. The study of atmospheric phenomena is fundamental to our understanding of environmental phenomena that underly many scenarios in our daily lives. The open data provided by the Copernicus missions are crucial for advancing scientific knowledge of marine dynamics and climate analysis."
"aftermath-hurricane-lisas-landfall-belize"	"On 2 November, Hurricane Lisa hit the coast of Belize. Lisa struck southwest of the former capital Belize City, accompanied by heavy rain and high winds, which resulted in flooding, uprooted trees and damaged properties. A state of emergency and a curfew were declared in different areas, and parts of the country were left without power. The Copernicus Emergency Management System (CEMS) Rapid Mapping component has been activated by the European Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) to monitor the impact of the storm (EMSR639). This image, acquired on 5 November 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows a plume of sediments just north of Belize City caused by river discharge, which remained strong three days after Lisa’s landfall. CEMS has recently released the Global Flooding Monitoring (GFM) tool, an innovative product based on Copernicus Sentinel-1 data that will allow continuous, systematic and automated satellite-based monitoring of all the land surface areas potentially affected by floods on a global scale."
"agricultural-fires-first-half-2021-democratic-republic-congo"	"This image, acquired on 12 June 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows agricultural fires in the Maniema province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Widespread fires are common from June to December in central Africa and, in particular, in DRC. These fires affect a mixture of farmland, grassland, savannah and tropical forests. In 2021, however, according to the Global Forest Watch website, the number of fires recorded was 13,673, an unusually low number compared to the overall number of fires in previous years. The decrease in the number of fires is partly linked to the exceptionally wet rainy season that caused severe flooding across DRC between February and April 2021. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor agricultural fires and their impact on land, vegetation and air quality."
"air-quality-europe-22-march-2022"	"Almost all of continental Europe is under persistent atmospheric high pressure. In addition to causing record barometric pressure values in Denmark, it has also negatively affected air quality, due to the reduced atmospheric circulation. In fact, as shown in this visualisation of the nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) measurements acquired on 22 March 2022 by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, the concentration values diffusely reached 0.1 mmol/m2 over Northern Italy, Germany, Northern France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland and Denmark. These values are comparable with the values measured by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite in March 2021 and confirm the trend of a return to pre-pandemic levels of NO2 pollution."
"air-quality-london"	"According to a recent study published by the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA), the health sector costs of air pollution from roads are higher in London than in any other city in Europe. The research analysed the Eurostat pollution and demographic data from 2018 and WHO recommendations over an unprecedented number of sites across 30 different countries, namely the EU27, the UK, Norway, and Switzerland. The research quantifies the monetary value of premature death, hospital treatment, lost working days and other health costs caused by particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Diesel vehicles are one of the main contributors to the atmospheric pollution as they are the primary source of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air. In conjunction with particulate matter and ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide is responsible for nearly 500,000 premature deaths across Europe every year. This explains why the pollution level, combined with the size of the city, is a key factor in contributing to total healthcare costs. The study highlights that London, in particular, suffers from the highest social healthcare costs, at € 11,44bn a year, well ahead of other European cities such as Bucharest (€6.38bn), Berlin (€5.27bn), Warsaw (€4.25bn), Rome (€4.17bn), and Paris (€3.53bn). This map has been obtained by computing the average atmospheric concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the NO2 measurements provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission from 12 to 22 September 2020. The image shows this distribution over a large area of southern England, visually centered in the city of London. Nitrogen Dioxide is an important atmospheric pollutant affecting air quality: detailed and continuous observations of NO2 are necessary to better assess its impact on climate and atmospheric pollution. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite allows daily measurements of NO2 levels with an unprecedented level of detail on a global scale."
"air-quality-northern-italy-1-march-2021"	"Saharan dust intrusions and an anomalously high atmospheric pressure recorded in the last days of February 2021 have caused a widespread deterioration of air quality in Europe. This image, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P Satellite on 1 March 2021, shows the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) in Northern Italy. The region, because of its orography (the Alps blocking surface atmospheric circulation), has been particularly affected by this dangerous pollutant which is released during fuel combustion. On the day of acquisition of the Copernicus data used to generate this image, extraordinary measures to improve air quality have been imposed by the regional Po Basin Project (Progetto Bacino Padano). These measures include restrictions on the use of vehicles that produce a high degree of pollution and limits on average household temperatures, as well as a ban on the distribution of nitrogenous compounds and the burning of organic material for agricultural purposes. The Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission is the first Copernicus mission dedicated to monitoring the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. Its main objective is to perform measurements of air quality, climate forcing, UV radiation and ozone concentration with a high spatio-temporal resolution. Its main objective is to perform measurements of pollutants which affect air quality (NO₂, CO, Aerosols, Ozone, SO₂, Formaldehyde, Methane) and climate forcing, with a high spatio-temporal resolution."
"air-quality-northern-italy-15-october-2021"	"This image is a visualisation of the data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite on 15 October 2021 and shows the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) in the Po Valley in northern Italy. The NO₂ levels measured by Sentinel-5P in mid-October are higher than those measured at the beginning of March 2021 (values 0.125 mmol/m2 higher than the 0.1 mmol/m2 in March). This results from the presence of a strong high pressure system that affected atmospheric circulation and caused a widespread deterioration in air quality. The Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission is the first Copernicus satellite mission dedicated to monitoring the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. Its main objective is to perform measurements of air quality, climate forcing (external factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions or volcanoes, which affect the climate’s energy balance), UV radiation and ozone concentration with high spatio-temporal resolution."
"air-quality-south-america-heavily-degraded-increasing-number-fires-brazil"	"In recent weeks, the overall number of wildfires in northwest Brazil has increased significantly and is seriously affecting air quality in South America. This image shows the Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels as measured by Copernicus Sentinel5-P between 20 and 24 August."
"al-sawa-lake-has-completely-dried"	"The Sawa Lake, in the southern province of Muthanna in Iraq, has now completely dried up, after a second consecutive year of severe drought in the country. In fact, the rising temperatures, together with a drastic decrease in water levels of the Tigris and Euphrates, have caused extreme droughts across the county. According to a spokesperson of the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources, the Sawa Lake has now completely dried up for the first time in Iraq’s history. The dramatic change is shown in these images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 19 April 2017 and 18 April 2022. It is evident that after only five years the water is now completely absent."
"aletsch-glacier-threatened-climate-change"	"This three-dimensional visualisation of the image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 June 2021, shows the Aletsch Glacier. In the heart of Switzerland, the Aletsch is the largest glacier in the Alps. In recognition of its importance and unique characteristics, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. However, climate change is threatening its very existence. According to a new study published in the scientific journal The Cryosphere, it could lose about half of its current volume by 2100 as a result of a 1°C increase in the planet's average temperature. With an average revisit time at the equator of five days, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide crucial data that is used to monitor the impact of climate change and its consequences on alpine environments."
"alex-storm"	"Alex is the first storm to hit southwestern Europe in the 2020-2021 season. After hovering over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, it made landfall on the coasts of Brittany and northwestern France on 1 September. According to Méteo France, heavy rainfalls and winds of up to 150km/h were reported in the department of Morbihan, causing damages to railways and power cut-offs. After impacting France, storm Alex reached southern Britain on Friday and, according to the MetOffice, parts of Wales, southwest England and eastern Scotland could see over 100mm of rain falling over the weekend, with significant impact in terms of flooding, risk of landslides, along with very difficult driving conditions. This true colour image has been captured by one of the two Sentinel-3 satellites on 2 October and shows the structure of storm Alex affecting southwest England with wet and windy weather as indicated in the Met Office forecasts. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are both equipped with multiple instruments. Among those, the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) provides data containing information about the atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and water vapour) that is essential for climate studies and weather forecasting."
"algal-bloom-baltic-sea"	"On 24 June, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites acquired this image of swirling green blooms in the Baltic Sea off the coast of the island of Gotland (Sweden). This bloom was probably triggered by the heat waves that affected the area during the second part of June. According to data published by the Danish Meteorological Institute, the sea temperature in this part of the Baltic Sea has an anomaly of up to +5°C compared to the refence period (1985-2000). Data from Copernicus missions are particularly well suited to detecting and monitoring Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) worldwide."
"algal-bloom-baltic-sea-july-2020"	"The warm weather of the summer of 2020 has increased the intensity of biological activity in the central Baltic Sea. On 16 July one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites acquired this image of swirling green blooms in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Latvia (Lat: 56.3, Lng: 20.6). Analysis of satellite imagery suggests that these green blooms are likely to be cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), an ancient type of marine bacteria that captures and stores solar energy through photosynthesis (as plants do). High water temperature and sunny, calm weather often lead to particularly large blooms that affect local ecosystems and, often, aquaculture and tourism. The resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites (10 m in multiple bands) allows Copernicus services to monitor biological activity and water quality around the world."
"algal-bloom-lake-valencia-venezuela"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 January 2021, shows a massive algal bloom in Lake Valencia, in northern Venezuela. Lake Valencia, formerly Lake Tacarigua, is the largest freshwater lake in the country. Since 1976 the lake is affected by algal blooms caused by the continuous influx of untreated wastewater from the surrounding urban, agricultural, and industrial land uses. This contributes to ongoing eutrophication, contamination, and salinisation of the lake. Recently, the National Environmental Commission of Venezuela has indicated that the pollution of Lake Valencia as one of the urgent environmental issues which the country need to be addressed. The resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites (10 m in most of the spectral bands) allows to monitor biological activity and water quality around the world."
"algeciras-and-gibraltar"	"The Bay of Algeciras, in the south of Spain’s autonomous region of Andalusia, hosts two important port cities: Algeciras and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. The Bay has been a hub connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea for the past 300 years. Algeciras is one of the largest ports in Europe and in the world in three categories: container traffic, cargo and transhipment. Both ports have been affected by the COVIDー19 crisis: in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 July, several moored (red) tankers are visible in the bay and east of Gibraltar, probably as a consequence of the economic slowdown. Data captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allow many applications in the marine domain such as monitoring water quality and pollution, or maritime surveillance."
"amazon-rainforest-para-state-brazil"	"The Amazon rainforest, with its 2,500 tree vegetal species, is one of the most biodiverse biomes on Earth. However, due to its complexity, it is particularly sensitive to the decrease in rainfall. According to a new study published in Nature Communications, at least 40% of the Amazon rainforest is at risk of reaching a tipping point at which it would become a savanna-type ecosystem. According to its authors, the causes are to be found in the decrease in rainfall due to rising greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. This Natural Colour Image of the Amazon rainforest in the Para’ state in Brazil has been captured by the OLCI (Ocean Land and Colour Instrument) of one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite on 28 July 2020. It shows one of the many areas which could be affected by this vegetal degradation. The daily acquisition frequency of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites provides greater opportunities to acquire cloud-free optical data and study changes of the land cover in complexes biomes."
"amazon-river"	"Having its source in the Peruvian Andes and flowing into the Atlantic Ocean 6,450 km away, after passing through Brazil, the Amazon River is one the longest rivers in the world. More than 2,500 species of mammals, amphibians and water snakes have been identified in its waters, making the Amazon the first river in the world in terms of animal biodiversity. Its vegetal biodiversity also has unique characteristics, being linked to the Amazonian rainforest, which houses at least 10% of the world's known endemic and endangered flora and fauna species. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 August 2017, shows a very rare almost completely cloudless view of the Amazon River estuary. Thanks to the very high acquisition frequency, the data derived from Sentinel-2 are the basis of the most recent studies on biodiversity in Amazonian rainforest."
"amsterdam-airport"	"COVID-19 has brought devastating consequences to all economic sectors, and air travel has been almost completely cancelled. Official estimates report that the number of flights during April 2020 experienced an 88% reduction. This image acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 on 10 April shows several airplanes parked at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands, waiting for air traffic to resume. With a spatial resolution of 10, 20 and 60 m (depending on the spectral band), the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver crucial open data to monitor anthropogenic and natural changes in the environment."
"anchored-vessels-queueing-enter-port-singapore"	"In recent months, the Port of Singapore, one of the busiest ports in the world, has been experiencing congestion in its operations. Data from S&P Global Platts show that an average day in January 2021 saw about 46 vessels anchored at the Port of Singapore, a 59% increase compared to January 2020. According to media reports, the exceptional situation that has caused an increase in waiting time for ships docked outside of numerous global ports has come about due to a confluence of factors, including an unprecedented increase in cargo demand, congestion at all nodes of the global supply chain due to renewed COVID-19 lockdowns, a shortage of available containers, and the reliability of shipping sailing schedules falling to a 10-year low. This image, acquired on 20 November 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows more than 85 cargo vessels and tankers awaiting entry to the Port of Singapore. The combined use of radar and optical data captured by the Copernicus satellites provides useful information that can be used for maritime surveillance worldwide."
"anchored-vessels-queueing-panama-canal"	"The Panama Canal is an essential waterway, in particular for freighters carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States of America to markets in Asia (currently the largest consumers of LNG). Ships seeking passage through the canal must either book a time slot on which to cross, or spontaneously cross when no other bookings have been made. Due to an increase in maritime traffic and time-consuming COVID-19 safety procedures, vessels wanting to cross in October and November of this year with no booking have had to wait for days to pass through, which has forced some shipping companies to find alternative routes. The waiting time, estimated to be between 10 and 15 days, has contributed to the cost of chartering LNG tankers to rise rapidly and disrupted the LNG supply chain. This image, acquired on 20 November 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows 60+ vessels anchored off the Panama Canal’s Pacific entrance, waiting to cross over to the Atlantic. The combined use of data provided by the satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions provides essential information for maritime surveillance."
"annular-eclipse-svalbard-archipelago"	"On Thursday 10 June 2021 a solar eclipse was visible in many countries of the northern hemisphere. Among the luckiest viewers were the inhabitants of the Arctic Circle, from Canada to Russia, who enjoyed a unique spectacle. The eclipse did not obscure the sun entirely as it was an annular eclipse. As a result of this particular phenomenon, the shadow of the Moon projected on the Earth did not completely obscure the sky and a small amount of light continued to reach the Earth's surface. This Copernicus Sentinel-3A image acquired on 10 June at 11:04 UTC shows the shadow area from the eclipse around Norway’s Svalbard Archipelago."
"annular-solar-eclipse"	"On 21 June 2020, a rare annular solar eclipse occurred on the summer solstice – the longest day of the year. An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun, but because it is closer to the Sun than the Earth, the moon does not fully obscure the sun. This geometry leaves the Sun’s edges exposed and a total eclipse does not occur. Instead, we see a small red-orange ring, or the ring of fire as it is commonly referred to, of the sun’s solar disk. The eclipse began at 4:47 UTC. It was visible over central Africa, the southern Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, Northern India and South Central China, it ended over the Pacific Ocean. At 5:53 UTC, the Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite acquired a unique image of the eclipse, capturing the shadow of the Moon projected over Pakistan. When the Moon passed in front of the Sun, Earth’s surface appeared black, as can be seen in the right half of image."
"another-heatwave-hits-western-europe"	"A new heatwave, the fourth since the beginning of June 2022, is ongoing in central and western Europe. According to the national weather services, air temperatures between 9 and 14 August could again exceed 44°C in Spain, 40°C in France, 35°C in the south of the United Kingdom and 30°C in the Netherlands. This new heatwave is associated with a robust high-pressure figure causing cloudlessness over much of western Europe, as shown in this image acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 on 9 August. Furthermore, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, the Fire Danger Forecast during the peak days of the heat wave will reach 'Very extreme danger' values in France and Spain."
"another-major-fire-ongoing-portugal"	"Portugal continues to grapple with devastating wildfires. On 5 August, a blaze erupted near Odemira, in the Alentejo region, prompting a massive response with more than 800 firefighters and 202 vehicles to control the flames. The severity of the fire resulted in the evacuation of four communities in Odemira (Vale dos Alhos, Vale de Água, Choça dos Vales, and Relva Grande) and a rural tourism area. The fire also encroached upon two protected areas, the Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina and Zonas de Protecção Especial de Monchique, putting unique ecosystems and wildlife at significant risk. This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 August, shows the hotspots and the massive smoke cloud generated by the wildfire reaching the Atlantic Ocean."
"antarcticas-larsen-c-ice-shelf-threatened-climate-change"	"This image, acquired by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission on 16 February 2021, shows the northern edge of the Larsen C ice shelf in Antarctica. According to a study recently published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters, more than a third of the Antarctic ice shelves are at risk of collapsing into the sea if global temperatures were to exceed pre-industrial levels by 4°C. Among the ice shelves investigated in the study, Larsen C is one of the four found to be at risk of disintegration. Larsen C had already made headline news in 2017, when it calved an enormous iceberg known as A-68, which drifted for nearly three years, threatening to run aground off the island of Saint George in the South Pacific in the autumn of 2020 and eventually disintegrating. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission consists of twin satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B), which both carry a multispectral optical sensor with 13 spectral channels and a maximum spatial resolution of 10 metres. Thanks to these characteristics, the Sentinel-2 satellites enable the monitoring of the process of ice formation and melting in the often inaccessible polar regions."
"anti-atlas-mountains"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellite on 16 October 2020, shows the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco. The Anti-Atlas Mountains formed as a result of the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates about 80 million years ago. This collision destroyed the Tethys Ocean. The limestone, sandstone, claystone and gypsum layers that formed the ocean bed were folded and crumpled to create the Anti-Atlas Mountains. In this false colour image, several bands of the multispectral imager onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite (visible and infrared bands) are combined to highlight the different rock types and illustrate the complex folding. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, provides multispectral imagery with 13 different spectral bands at a maximum spatial resolution of 10m. These multispectral data allow High Resolution mapping of land changes and geological features."
"antwerpen-blanketed-snow-belgium"	"In the aftermath of Storm Darcy that hit Europe in the second week of February 2021, regions that rarely experience heavy snowfall have been blanketed in snow. The storm, which originated in Russia, has affected Northern European countries the most, causing major disruptions in daily life. The Netherlands has experienced its first large snowstorm in the past ten years, with disrupted air and rail traffic, and disruptions due to the snow were also recorded throughout the entire rail and road traffic network in Germany. In Brussels, the three largest train stations are temporarily being kept open for 24 hours a day to shelter the homeless from the snow and freezing temperatures. Storm Darcy is the latest extreme weather phenomenon in a particularly cold winter in Northern Europe. According to a report published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service on 9 February, the entire month of January 2021 was colder than average. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 February 2021, shows Antwerpen covered with snow. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides high-resolution data are that can be used to produce detailed snow and ice map of Europe."
"apennine-range-italy-covered-snow"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 13 March 2022, shows the snow cover on the Apennine range in central Italy. In south-eastern Europe, the first ten days of March 2022 have been characterised by cold temperatures and snowfall, as opposed to January and February, where temperatures were higher than average. In the past days, minimum temperatures have reached lows of -9°C in Italy, -25°C in the Balkans and -28°C on Mount Parnassus in Greece. The anticyclone that had brought mild and scarce precipitations temperatures in January and February has in fact now moved, causing cold arctic currents to shift towards Europe and on the Mediterranean."
"archipelago-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 30 May 2021, shows a cloudless view of the Archipelago Sea, or Saaristomeri, in the Baltic Sea. It is located in south-west Finland and is home to the most complex archipelago in the world. It features tens of thousands of small islands and reefs, hundreds of coastal lagoons and narrow inlets that provide a unique and diverse environment for wildlife. The greatest threat to the environment is the eutrophication caused mainly by agriculture and fish farming. Since 2014, in order to improve the state of water quality and biodiversity in the area, the European Commission has been implementing actions to improve the environmental conditions of the Baltic Sea through the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR)."
"arctic-heat-wave"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 May 2022, shows the significant discharge of sediment into the Arctic Ocean due to melting snow and glaciers around Longyearbyen in the Svalbard archipelago in Norway. The massive melting is caused by an ongoing heatwave in the Arctic. According to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, on 28 May, at Akseløya, an island 60 km southeast of Longyearbyen, the temperature rose to 10.5°C, the highest value for the month of May in 46 years of observations. Additionally, according to the University of Liège's climatology laboratory, on the day of this image acquisition, the surface melting at the Svalbard archipelago reached a record high value for the end of May. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in the earth's surface with great detail, even at northern latitudes, and monitor the melting of glaciers."
"arctic-microplastic-pollution-svalbard-archipelago"	"Plastic particles are increasingly recognised as global contaminants as they have reached even the most remote areas of the planet, including the Arctic Ocean. A recent study that has been published in the Nature Communications scientific journal reveals that 92% of microplastic pollution found in sampled seawater across the Arctic is made of synthetic fibres. Of this, around 73 percent was found to be polyester, resembling the dimensions and chemical signature of synthetic textiles, particularly clothing. As stated by one of the authors of the study, there is strong evidence that homes in Europe and North America are directly polluting the Arctic with fibres from washing machines sewage. This SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) false colour image, that has been acquired by one of the two Sentinel-1 satellites on 13 January 2020, shows, mostly visible in white, two islands of the Svalbard Archipelago in Norway. The one on the left, not completely visible, is Spitsbergen, the largest island of the archipelago, while the one on the right is Nordaustlandet, the second largest. According to the results of the study, the seawater samples retrieved off the eastern Svalbard coast have some of the highest values of microplastic concentration among all the Arctic sites included in the research. RADAR data, as those provided by the Sentinel-1 mission, are not influenced by the presence of clouds, or by polar seasonal long nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring Polar Regions when optical sensors cannot be used."
"arctic-peatlands-lena-delta"	"Peatlands are a type of wetlands among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth: they are critical for preserving global biodiversity, providing safe drinking water, minimising flood risk and helping address climate change because they sequester 0.37 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year – storing more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined. A particular type of peatlands can be found in the Arctic tundra, “frozen” mires in which large quantities of organic deposits remain frozen throughout the years. Their hydrological regime and other characteristics are strongly dependent on the status and health of the permafrost. A recent study of the University of Stockholm found that, if the global warming scenarios are proven right, arctic peatlands will emit more carbon than they can store, because of the thawing of the permafrost, resulting in severe repercussions on the global climate. This image acquired on 31 July by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites shows a detail of the Lena Delta, in Siberia, whose landscape is characteristic of Arctic tundra. Copernicus Sentinel-2, with a maximum revisit time of five days, is very useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in such an important and delicate environment as the Arctic Circle."
"arctic-sea-ice-extent-remains-below-average"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 March 2022, shows the sea ice extending between Greenland and Iceland. According to the latest climate bulletin published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the extent of the Arctic sea ice in February 2022 was 2% below the 1991-2020 average for the same month. Even though the value is only slightly under average, this was the thirteenth consecutive February with a negative anomaly in sea ice extent. Precisely, the monthly average in February 2022 reached 14.7 million km2, 0.3 million km2 (or 2%) below the 1991-2020 average for the same month. Moreover, the Arctic sea ice extent has consistently been below average since July 2021. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) publishes monthly reports detailing the findings from sea ice extent monitoring, including sea ice maps that help to visualise the results of the high-quality analysis conducted by its scientists."
"arctic-sea-ice-reached-fifth-smallest-winter-extent-record"	"Arctic sea ice reached its maximum extent for the year on 6 March. It happens to be the fifth smallest winter extent in the 45-year satellite record. This Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite image captured on 30 March shows the extent of sea ice off the coast of Greenland. The melting of Arctic sea ice has a significant impact on the global climate, contributing to rising sea levels and changes in ocean dynamics. Copernicus' satellite data plays a crucial role in monitoring the melting of the cryosphere and tracking the effects of climate change around the globe."
"arctic-tundra-yamalsky-district-russia"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 September 2020, shows the status of the Arctic tundra in the Yamalsky District (Russia) in the beginning of the 2020 autumn. Arctic tundra is a unique ecosystem composed mainly of permafrost. Permafrost, according to current estimates, is the main source (45%) of all Arctic methane emissions, one of the most dangerous GHG. Due to climate change, Arctic regions have been warming faster than other global regions over the last century: warmer temperatures accelerate the decomposition of organic carbon in permafrost soils, resulting in higher net methane emissions. According a new research published in Global Change Biology, most of the methane emissions from thawing permafrost occurs in Autumn and climate change can contribute to further increasing emissions in the future. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, with a maximum revisit time of five days, are very useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in such an important and delicate environment as the Arctic Circle."
"areas-affected-historical-floods-ahrweiler-district-germany"	"These images, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 13 June and 18 July 2021, allow us to observe the areas damaged following the catastrophic floods that hit the Ahrweiler district in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany). Disastrous storms hit several Northern European countries with hundreds of casualties and missing people in Germany and Belgium. The West of Germany, over which these Sentinel-2 images were acquired, recorded one of the worst weather-related disasters since World War II. The Rapid Mapping component of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service has been activated and 50 maps providing a delineation of the areas affected by flooding and flood damage assessments over 20 Areas of Interest, have been delivered at the time of this publication, with 13 more in production. They are accessible for the activation in Germany (EMSR517), Belgium (EMSR518) and the Netherlands (EMSR519) by visiting the Copernicus EMS website. The high-resolution open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites allows to accurately delineate the extent of a flood and can be used for damage assessment."
"ash-etna-volcano-disperses-mediterranean-sea"	"During the night between 13 and 14 August 2023, the Etna volcano erupted, featuring scenic lava fountains. Within this paroxysm, the Southeast Crater emitted an ash plume, which dispersed in a southerly direction. As shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites at 09:23 UTC, less than 8 hours after the beginning of the eruption, the ash reached the centre of the Mediterranean Sea and travelled 300 km southeast of Malta. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites facilitate the surveillance of volcanoes worldwide, proving particularly adapted to monitoring volcanoes situated in remote regions."
"ash-plume-emitted-la-soufriere-volcano"	"This image, acquired on 9 April 2021 at 14:11 UTC by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, shows the ash plume emitted by La Soufriere volcano, located on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. The La Soufriere volcano, which has been inactive for decades, entered into an explosive phase on the morning of 9 April 2021 and emitted an ash plume that reached a height of 15 km. An evacuation order was issued for all residents of the red zone (about 16,000 people) and the Rapid Mapping component of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service was activated by the EU’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre. The maps and associated geospatial information will be made available here. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission provides multispectral data with 21 spectral bands that enable the development of innovative global dynamic applications."
"atchafalaya-river-delta-louisiana-usa"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 5 January 2021, shows the delta of the Atchafalaya River (Louisiana, USA). According to a new study published in the Geophysical Research Letters scientific journal, approximately one-third of all of the major rivers in the United States have changed colour over the past 34 years. Half of these rivers, as for instance the waters of the Atchafalaya River, have become yellow (a sign that waters are heavily laden with sediment), others have become green (an indication of large amounts of algae). Only 8% of the US rivers have remained mostly blue. Although river colour is not necessarily an indicator of a water body’s health, the study noted that some rivers had changed to less natural colours, most likely due to pollution or other dissolved organic matter. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides continuous, high-frequency water quality monitoring of coastal waters."
"atlantic-meridional-overturning-circulation-weakest-point-millennium"	"Sea surface temperature is a fundamental physical variable used to understand, quantify and predict the complex interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. This image depicts the sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean forecasted by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, on 8 March 2021. In conjunction with other ocean parameters, sea surface temperature is used to map historical trends of the Gulf Stream and the wider circulatory system of surface and deep currents that it is part of, which is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). AMOC is one of the major oceanic circulation systems which redistributes heat and therefore has a major impact on our planet’s climate. A research study recently published in the Nature Geoscience scientific journal has determined that the activity of AMOC has now fallen to a historical low. Due to the effects of climate change that causes major changes in ocean currents by transporting warm water to Europe and influence storms, AMOC is now at its weakest point in the past millennium. The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) provides oceanographic products and services for maritime safety, coastal and marine environment monitoring, climate and weather forecasting and marine resource uses. The CMEMS portfolio includes more than 150 products that are obtained using a combination of in-situ ocean observations, remote sensing satellite images provided by Copernicus missions and ocean forecast models, which are updated daily."
"august-complex-wildfire-california"	"The August Complex is a massive wildfire burning Northern California. It originated as 38 individual fires started by lightning strikes on 16 August 2020 merged. As of 20 September 2020, the burnt area stood at 832,891 acres (337,058 ha or 3,370 km2) and, due its massive extension, it is listed as both the single-largest wildfire and the largest fire complex in California since record-keeping began. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on19 September shows the burn scar and a fronts still active of the August Complex wildfire. Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite is a two-spacecraft satellite mission useful to deliver strategic data to improve knowledge about wildfires and climate change."
"austria-otztal"	"Ötztal is an alpine valley that separates the Stubai Alps from the Ötztal Alps. The valley’s southern end terminates at the border with Italy, while the northern end is located where the rivers Inn and Ötztaler Ache meet.

This image was acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 23 September 2022."
"autumn-colours-north-america"	"Autumn is continuing to transform the looks of the mountains of the northern hemisphere, allowing us to capture spectacular views from space. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 27 October 2022, shows the Appalachians, a mountain ridge bordering the east coast of North America, tinged with vibrant autumn colours. It is not widely known that autumn foliage colour can be affected by drought. Vegetation is heavily influenced by the lack of summer precipitation, which causes less vibrant foliage colours and earlier leaf fall. The open data from the Copernicus programme are particularly useful for forest monitoring and management. For example, data released daily by Sentinel satellites offer the possibility of monitoring the health of forests, while data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service provide particularly suitable data for forest management."
"autumn-colours-romanian-carpathians"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 October 2021, shows the changing colours of the Romanian forests, a yearly phenomenon which occurs in mid-Autumn. With 27% of its territory being covered in forests, Romania is home to some of the largest woodland-covered areas in Europe, nestled principally in the Carpathian Mountains. These forests, some of which are also among the oldest in Europe, are amongst the richest temperate forest ecosystems in Europe and the world. As such, they are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species. Pictured here is the Buila-Vânturarița National Park, a protected area in the Southern Carpathians, the second highest group of mountains in the Carpathian Mountain range. The park was established in 2005 to protect the fauna and flora native to the Southern Carpathians, and covers an area of 4,186 ha. The Buila massif, at 1,885m, has its upper elevations covered in typical alpine shrub vegetation, mainly juniper. A short transition area of coniferous species features forests of pine, yew, fir, or spruce (in dark green). Deciduous species of oak, beech, ash, linden, or birch are predominant in the park. Their foliage changes colour as the temperature drops in the autumn, creating a beautifully patterned landscape in shades of brown, yellow, and vibrant green. Copernicus data and services are particularly useful for forest monitoring and management. For example, data released daily by the Sentinel satellites offer the opportunity to monitor the health of forests, while data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service provide high-resolution geodata particularly suitable for forest management."
"autumn-foliage-italy"	"Each year, autumn foliage transforms mountainous landscapes in various areas of the world as a result of the senescence – or ageing – process of the leaves that paints forests in red, orange, yellow and brown tones. One of such landscape in Europe is the Tuscan-Emilian Apennine National Park, a UNESCO biosphere reserve located in central Italy. The site is home to a significant biodiversity, as it contains more than 70% of the total number of species present in Italy, including 122 bird species. This image, acquired on 8 October 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the beautiful and warm colours of the foliage in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennine National Park. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites make it possible to extract comprehensive information on the state of natural areas with dense vegetation, as well as contribute to the monitoring and preservation of biodiversity around the world."
"autumn-foliage-shines-canada"	"Each year, autumn foliage transforms urban and suburban landscapes in a few areas of the world, with North America and Canada being the most prominent. This phenomenon is caused by the senescence, or ageing, of the leaves that paints forest canopies in an explosion of vermillion red, orange, yellow and brown. One of the places in Canada where it is possible to observe this phenomenon is the La Mauricie National Park, shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image from 7 October 2021. This national park is a protected area of over 500 square kilometres halfway between Quebec City and Montreal. With a revisit time of five days, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver comprehensive information on the state of natural areas with dense vegetation."

"bahia-de-cadiz-natural-park-andalucia-spain"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 March 2021, shows the Bahía de Cádiz Natural Park in Andalucia, Spain. Located between the Doñana National Park and the Strait of Gibraltar, the Bahía de Cádiz is protected under two EU legal instruments: it is a Special Protection Area under the Birds Directive, a Site of Community Importance under the Habitats Directive, and a Natura 2020 site. It is also a RAMSAR site. The mild climate and the availability of nutrients due to the easy circulation of water make the Bahía de Cádiz an area rich in biodiversity: official reports record over two hundred species of birds (more than 65,000 individuals during wintering), 60 of fish and 81 of macroinvertebrates (crustaceans and molluscs), some of which are included in the IUCN Red List. The Copernicus Sentinel missions provide over 15 terabytes of open data everyday which contribute to monitoring the state of biodiversity around the world."
"baltic-sea"	"The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea bordered by eight EU Member States (Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden) and Russia. Every summer, colourful blooms of phytoplankton can be observed in the shallow water of the Baltic Sea They have intensified as a result of increased nutrient runoff from land around the sea (mainly because of agricultural fertilisers and sewage). Algal Harmful Blooms are also one of the issues that affect the Baltic Sea. Biodiversity loss, climate change, eutrophication, overfishing, plastic waste, are other examples of environmental problems that impact the health of the Baltic. For this reason, on 28 September 2020, Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries is organising “OurBaltic”, a high-level conference to boost the development of possible actions to improve the situation. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 27 July 2019 shows a very large algal bloom in the southern part of the Baltic Sea Thanks to its ability to monitor ocean colour, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow us to better understand marine life, survey biological constituents and their activity."
"banc-darguin-national-park-mauritania"	"This image, acquired on 2 January 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the Banc d'Arguin National Park off the coast of Mauritania. The Banc d'Arguin National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the major breeding site for migratory birds from northern Europe, Siberia and Greenland, including flamingos, broad-billed sandpipers, pelicans and terns. The surrounding waters are amongst the richest fishing waters in western Africa and serve as nesting grounds for the entire region. The bloom in the waters of the Banc D’Arguin visible in this image is due to a combination of phytoplankton and sediments. The particular climatic conditions of the area allow a continuous mixing of the cold and nutrient-rich waters, facilitating a persistent phytoplankton bloom throughout the year. Blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem, and therefore, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. The Copernicus Sentinel missions provide high frequency data useful for monitoring the water quality of coastal waters."
"bay-bourgneuf-france"	"The Bay of Bourgneuf is a unique natural site on the French Atlantic coast. Because of its biodiversity and scenic beauty, the area has been classified as a site protected by the Ramsar Convention. The are is also a Natura 2000 site. Copernicus Sentinel-2 acquired this natural colour image on 22 March 2022."
"bay-concepcion-chile"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 17 December 2020 shows the Bay of Concepcion, a natural bay located on the coast of the province of Concepción in the Bío Bío Region of Chile. Since the 1950s, the area has seen the growth of the metallurgical and fishing industries, an increased military presence and port capacity. Today, the bay hosts two of the most important Chilean ports, Penco and Talcahuano. The Bahía de Concepción is open to the Pacific in the NW direction, which facilitates, during the austral spring-summer, the influx of nutrient-rich waters that boost phytoplankton blooms. Another particular phenomenon observed in the bay is the discolouration of the waters that occurs during summers of non-El Niño years. Phytoplankton blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem, and therefore, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. The Copernicus Sentinel missions provide continuous, high-frequency water quality monitoring of coastal waters."
"bay-mont-saint-michel-france"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 30 July 2020, shows the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel in northern France. The bay, which is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site, is famous for having one of the widest tidal ranges in continental Europe, with a difference of more than 15m in height between high and low tide. At the peak of low tide, the sea retreats by roughly 15 km. The famous islet of Mont Saint-Michel is located in the south of the bay and is home to a Benedictine monastery and a small village. Due to the harsh weather conditions prevailing in the area, the buildings on the island need to be continuously restored. A major restoration effort will commence in early November 2020 and require scaffoldings as high as the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Data acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 are useful for monitoring the effects of tides on water quality: Tides influence the presence of suspended matter and concentration of chlorophyll in the water which, in turn, impacts aquaculture practices."

"berlengas-archipelago-portugal"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 November 2022, shows the Berlengas Archipelago, which is located off the Portuguese coast, in the Atlantic Ocean. There are no permanent residents on the archipelago, which is a natural reserve maintained in near pristine conditions, allowing various bird species to find refuge during their migration. Endangered species such as the puffin can also be found on the islands. The protected area includes an important marine reserve, and it is part of the Natura2000 network. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and Services make it possible to extract key information that contributes to the monitoring and preservation of biodiversity around the world."
"betsiboka-river-estuary"	"The Betsiboka River Estuary is the mouth of the largest river of Madagascar. Nearly a century of logging of Madagascar's rainforests and mangrove forests has resulted in complete deforestation and significant rates of land erosion. After heavy rain, the bright red soils, typical of the island, are washed away and end up in the waters of the river. This image, composed using two scenes acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 and 23 May 2020, allows a comparison of the sediment load transported in the waters of the Betsiboka River before and after heavy rains occurred between 19 and 20 May 2020. Data obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel missions, due their multispectral characteristics, are particularly suitable for monitoring coastal and soil erosion."
"bialowieza-forest-poland"	"Forests bring many environmental benefits, such reducing the risk of drought, floods and soil degradation, as well as improving air and water quality. They also play a fundamental role in fighting climate change. As a matter of fact, when the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increase, forests take up more carbon from the atmosphere as a result of increased photosynthesis activity, through a process known as CO2 fertilisation. New research, published in Science at the beginning of December 2020, shows that the fertilising effect of CO2 is decreasing worldwide: the study concludes that the reduction has reached 50% progressively since 1982 and that there will be strong consequences on the carbon cycle and therefore on the climate. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 21 September 2020 shows the Bialowieza Forest, one of the largest and oldest “primary” forests in Europe and one of the largest carbon sinks on the continent. With a revisit time of five days, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver information over all the phases of the vegetative cycle."
"bird-population-panamas-rainforest-severe-decline"	"The Soberania National Park is a protected neotropical forest located in central Panama. It is visible in this image, acquired on 10 December 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. A recent study, based on long-term monitoring in the Soberania National Park, reveals a widespread and severe decline in the bird population in the time period spanning from 1977 to 2020. The researchers’ findings provide evidence that even the population of tropical birds nesting in relatively intact forests may be undergoing a systematic decline. In fact, 35 out of the 40 declining species sampled have lost more than 50% of their initial population, whereas only two species have increased in numbers."
"birth-five-new-large-icebergs-weddell-sea"	"The D-28 iceberg is a berg of about 2000 km2 that had been drifting undisturbed in the Weddell Sea since its calving in 2019. Between the end of May and the beginning of June 2021, D-28 collided with the ice shelves in the Queen Maud Land region of Antarctica. As shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 12 June, the impact created five new icebergs: D-29A, D-29B, D-29C, D-30A and D-30B. The B-39 iceberg is also visible in the image, but it was already present in the area before the impact of D-28. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is a RADAR mission that has the specificity of providing data that are not affected by the presence of clouds, nor by the long seasonal polar nights.

"black-smoke-cloud-generated-rockton-plant-fire-usa"	"This image, acquired on 14 June 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows a dense smoke cloud emitted by a major fire at an industrial plant in Illinois (USA). A few hours before the image was acquired, a fire broke out at the Chemtool Inc. plant near Rockton. The fire was so violent that it generated a dense cloud of black smoke that spread for several kilometres to the SSE of the incident site. The Open Data provided by Copernicus Sentinel satellite missions and services allow us to assess the consequences of natural and industrial fires on air quality and vegetation."
"bleached-sea-sponges-found-new-zealand-waters"	"Bleached sea sponges have been found off New Zealand’s coastline for the first time. The alarming discovery took place at multiple sites near the Breaksea Sound fjord, visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 May 2022. In some areas, up to 95% of the sponges were bleached. Sea sponges are very common in New Zealand, dominating the ocean floor around the country and playing a crucial role in creating a welcoming habitat for fish and other marine species. The extreme ocean temperatures recorded in 2021, New Zealand’s hottest year on record are believed to be responsible for the bleaching episode. The ocean warming persisted in April 2022, with coastal water temperatures up to 2.6°C above average, according to the National Institute for Water and Atmospherics. Data from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites support the mapping of marine habitats, water quality studies and bathymetry (the study of ocean and lake floors), which are vital for ocean floor health assessment and monitoring around the globe."
"bloom-south-atlantic-ocean-end-december-2021"	"On 30 December 2021, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured multiple phytoplankton blooms off the coast of Argentina. In this area of the South Atlantic Ocean, it is common to observe blooms that extend for hundreds of kilometres. Between December and February (the period between late spring and early summer in the southern hemisphere), conditions are optimal for phytoplankton reproduction thanks to long periods of sunshine and a bountiful supply of nutrients from the Patagonian coast. Blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem. As such, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites provide continuous, high frequency water quality monitoring over coastal areas."
"blooms-south-atlantic-ocean-end-november-2022"	"On 26 November 2022, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured multiple phytoplankton blooms off the coast of the Falkland/Malvinas Archipelago. In this area of the South Atlantic Ocean, it is common to observe blooms extending over hundreds of square kilometres. However, this bloom has already exceeded an extension of about 600,000 square kilometres, a value that had not been reached at the end of November since 2008. Phytoplankton blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites provide high-frequency water quality monitoring of the oceans."
"bombogenesis-snowstorm-new-york"	"Over the final weekend of January 2022, the northeast of the United States was hit by a massive “Nor’easter” snowstorm. The result, as shown in this Sentinel-2 image acquired on Sunday 30 January, was a record 18.5cm of snow in Central Park, New York. This latest “bombogenesis” snowstorm – in which the mixing of cold air with warmer oceanic air causes atmospheric pressure to drop rapidly – is the latest in a series of increasingly intense winter storms in this part of the United States. According to Justin Mankin, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College, warmer Atlantic Ocean temperatures “likely intensified the storm above and beyond what it would have been” and are a “signature of global warming”. Warming ocean temperatures are one of the most significant consequences of global warming. The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service’s Sea Surface Temperature Thematic Assembly Centre provides state of the art products based primarily on satellite observational data which can be used to monitor ocean temperatures closely."

"bracciano-lake-italy"	"Lake ecosystems, and the organisms that live within them, are vulnerable to temperature changes, including the increased occurrence of thermal extremes. However, very little is known about lake heatwaves—periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature—and how they may change under global warming. According to a study that has been recently published in Nature, lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century, with a widespread influence on lakes’ physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. The study is based on a numerical model that has been used to investigate changes in lake heatwaves at hundreds of lakes worldwide included in the World Lake Database. This image, that was captured by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission on 11 December 2020, shows Lake Bracciano, a lake of volcanic origin in the Italian region of Lazio, 32 km northwest of Rome. It is the second largest lake in the region (second only to Lake Bolsena) and one of the major lakes of Italy. Lake Bracciano, which is included in the World Lake Database, is one of the lakes that have been investigated in the study and is a clear example of how progressive climate changes can cause the lake to be affected by eutrophication, the process by which a body of water becomes overly enriched with minerals and nutrients and which induces excessive growth of algae. Longer and more intense lake heatwaves could certainly influence the eutrophication phenomena with negative consequences for the water quality. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, that is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, provides multispectral data over 13 different spectral bands with a maximum spatial resolution of 10 metres, allowing to implement innovative applications to monitor inland waters worldwide."
"brazilian-amazon-gripped-severe-drought"	"A few months after disastrous floods affected the country in May and June 2022, Brazil’s Amazon is currently experiencing the consequences of a severe drought. Lower-than-average rainfall in August and September has in fact caused the river water levels to rapidly decrease. Local communities are especially vulnerable to this situation, as they often relay on waterways for the transportation of essential goods such as food and fuel. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 October 2021 and 20 October 2022, show the difference in water levels of the Tefé, a tributary of the Amazon River. At the homonymous town, large ships have not been able to dock because of insufficient water levels in the port. With a revisit time of five days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor droughts and their impact. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service also runs a European and a Global Drought Observatory."
"breidamerkurjokull-glacier-iceland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 August 2021, shows the Breidamerkurjokull glacier in Iceland. The Breidamerkurjokull glacier is the third largest glacier in Iceland. According to researchers at the University of Dundee, Scotland, it has reached an unprecedented melt rate during the summer of 2021, following an intense heatwave that affected the island in August. Researchers report that the glacier’s melt rate has been so intense that it has now reached a point of no return. It may well be that the glacier will never recover its lost ice, even with the formation of new ice during the winter season. Data from Copernicus satellites are used to monitor the movement of glaciers around the world."
"brijuni-islands-national-park-croatia"	"Open data provided by the EU Space Programme, and in particular by its Copernicus Earth Observation component are key assets in the design, monitoring and assessment of the impact of protection and conservation measures for various ecosystems. They are used to design, monitor and assess the impact of key environmental policies of the European Union and support governmental authorities, researchers, non-governmental organisations and citizen scientists alike. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 March 2021, shows the Brijuni National Park in Croatia, an archipelago of fourteen small islands off the western coast of Istria, in Croatia. Among the other island groups scattered along this part of the Adriatic Sea, the Brijuni archipelago stands out due to its extraordinary biological diversity and the remnants of Ancient Roman architectural cultural heritage it hosts. About 80% of the area of the national park that has also been protected under the Natura 2000 Directive is marine, owing to its crucial role as a hatching ground. The area surrounding the Brijuni Islands is an oasis for the marine fauna typical of the northern Adriatic Sea, such as sea turtles and dolphins, and the seabed hosts a rich ecosystem of sponges, shellfish, sea urchins, crustaceans and fish. This precious natural and cultural heritage can be better preserved thanks to the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and Copernicus services. They provide open data to assess important ecological parameters such as vegetation health, risk of drought, air and water quality, as well as services such as oil spill detection, land cover and land use monitoring, and wildfire early warning and monitoring."
"bruges-blanketed-snow-belgium"	"In the aftermath of Storm Darcy that hit Europe in the second week of February 2021, regions that rarely experience heavy snowfall have been blanketed in snow. The storm, which originated in Russia, has affected Northern European countries the most, causing major disruptions in daily life. The Netherlands has experienced its first large snowstorm in the past ten years, with disrupted air and rail traffic, and disruptions due to the snow were also recorded throughout the entire rail and road traffic network in Germany. In Brussels, the three largest train stations are temporarily being kept open for 24 hours a day to shelter the homeless from the snow and freezing temperatures. Storm Darcy is the latest extreme weather phenomenon in a particularly cold winter in Northern Europe. According to a report published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service on 9 February, the entire month of January 2021 was colder than average.

"brunt-ice-shelf-and-berg-1"	"The Brunt Ice Shelf (BIS) is an area of floating ice bordering the coast of Coats Land in the Weddell Sea sector of Antarctica. Cracks appear often on ice shelves as the ice deforms. In 2012 satellite monitoring revealed the first signs of movement in a chasm (Chasm 1) that had laid dormant for at least 35 years. Since then, this chasm has continued to grow until today. This cloud free image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 January 2020, shows that the last remaining connection between the BIS and the Berg-1 (name of the iceberg when it has calved) is less of 5km long and, according to Adrian Luckman, Professor at the University of Swansea, Berg-1 is moving away from the BIS with a velocity of about 2 m per day. When Berg1 will have calved, it will be a dimension about twice the size of New York City. The BIS is probably the most closely and thoroughly observed ice shelf on Earth. Besides a network of 15 GPS instruments which measures the deformation of the ice every day, satellite images from the European Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions are used to map the location of the rift tips and ice velocity."

On 24 July, a fire broke out in the western part of Sardinia. Hundreds of people were evacuated, and tens of thousands of hectares of vegetation were lost. The rapid mapping module of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service was activated to monitor the situation by the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre upon request of Italy’s Civil Protection. The high-resolution open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites allow the effects of fires on vegetation to be monitored."
"burn-scars-siberian-wildfires-arctic-circle"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 May 2021, is the first image acquired in 2021 of a burn scar from one of the dramatic 2020 wildfires in the Siberian Arctic. The burnt areas have been “well-preserved” by the snow. The 2020 fire season in Siberia will be remembered as one of the worst in recent history, with a total burned area of about 26 million hectares (260,000 square kilometres) according to scientists. The fires lasted for the entire summer and continued into October, by when the snow started covering the burn scars. This image shows the burnt area resulting from a wildfire that occurred in July 2020, 10 km north of Buor-Sysy in the Sakha Republic. This false colours image was obtained from a combination from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 spectral bands, including shortwave infrared channels that are widely used in vegetation monitoring, as well as in various fire monitoring applications."
"burnt-areas-argentina"	"During the first half of 2020 (coinciding with the southern hemisphere’s summer), severe drought conditions affected South America, in particular central and northern Great Chaco (Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina) and fringes of Pantanal (Brazil and Bolivia). One of the immediate effects was an increase in the number of wildfires: as reported by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE – Brazil’s Space Research Center), the overall number of fires increased by 245% in Argentina and 128% in Paraguay compared to the previous year. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 July, shows the burnt areas from recent fires around Palo Santo (Formosa Province – Argentina) in dark brown tones. With a revisit time of five days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor wildfires and their impact."
"bushfires-queensland-australia"	"Bushfires are affecting the Western Downs region of Queensland, Australia. These fires have burnt more than 7,400 hectares of vegetation, causing significant damage. On 16 February, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured a pyrocumulus cloud produced by a fire ongoing near Pelham. This type of cloud develops as a result of the intense heat of a wildfire, which causes the air to rise rapidly and creates a plume of smoke and ash. Through its advanced multispectral capabilities, Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites enable the monitoring of the impact of wildfires on vegetation."
"californias-lake-oroville-affected-severe-drought"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 June 2021, shows Lake Oroville in California. Lake Oroville is a reservoir that provides irrigation to about a quarter of the agricultural fields in northern California. Due to the extreme drought that is plaguing the entire state, its level is now only at 39% of its capacity - about 46% of its historical average. In addition to Oroville, California's other reservoirs are also confronted with severe drought. Since the beginning of May, a state of emergency drought has been declared for 41 of the state's 58 counties. Data from Copernicus missions provide information that can be used to accurately map water bodies and extract critical information during periods of drought."

"calving-brunt-ice-shelf"	"On 23 January, a massive iceberg, of 1,550 km2 (close to the size of the island of Gran Canaria or of Greater London), has calved from the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica. This image was acquired on 20 and 24 January by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites and shows the newly formed iceberg, named Chasm1, floating in the Weddell Sea. Iceberg calving is a natural process that occurs when the ice shelf reaches a certain size and the ice at the front edge breaks off. Scientists are closely monitoring the Brunt Ice Shelf and other ice shelves in Antarctica as global warming can lead to an increased number of calving events and contributes to sea level rise. Copernicus open data are key for tracking the movement of icebergs drifting in the ocean and the monitoring of remote environments such as Antarctica."
"calving-milne-ice-shelf-nunavut-canada"	"The Milne Ice Shelf is located in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. It is the second largest ice shelf in the Arctic Ocean. As shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-1 image acquired on 1 August 2020, a very large section of the Milne Ice Shelf has collapsed into the Arctic Ocean creating an ice island with a area of about 79 km2 (almost half the size of Liechtenstein). As reported by the Canadian Ice Service, causes of the collapse are linked to climate change (hot air temperature, strong offshore winds and absence of seaice). RADAR data obtained by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites are not affected by the presence of clouds, or by polar seasonal long nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring drifting icebergs or ice and glaciers."
"camargue-southern-france"	"This image, acquired on 1 February by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows Camargue, a wetland area in southern France. The Camargue covers more than 85,000 hectares with a multitude of marshes and salt lakes and is home to a broad variety of fauna in a wild and unspoilt landscape. In particular, it is home to Europe's largest colony of pink flamingos, as well as many other priority species listed in EU nature directives due to concerns regarding their population status and sensitivity to habitat alteration. It is also a Ramsar and Natura 2000 site. Climate change is seriously threatening Camargue. As a consequence of global warming and rising sea levels, reductions in the extent of beaches and the number of resident birds, as well as changes in the concentration of salt in the salt marshes, are already visible. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and Services make it possible to extract vital information on the state of implementation of European policies, including those relating to the monitoring of water quality and the protection of critical biodiversity sites."

"carbon-monoxide-generated-us-wildfires-reaches-europe"	"Extreme weather has battered the Western United States in September 2020, with multiple and out-of-control fires raging along the Pacific Coast. US states most affected were California and Oregon. In California, more than 1.47 million ha have burned so far and three of the state’s four largest wildfires on record have occurred between August and September 2020. In Oregon, the 2020 wildfire season is one of the most destructive on record as more than 400,000 ha of land have burned and hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The intensity of the fires produced unheard of amounts of smoke along the West Coast and released massive amount of pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide (CO), etc. in the atmosphere, and severely worsened the air quality of the affected areas. The amount of CO emitted during the fires was such that in 15 days it has reached Europe. This image, based on data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite on 24 September, shows the atmospheric CO over Europe. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric pollutants which affects air quality. Detailed and continuous observations of CO are necessary to better assess its impact on climate and atmospheric pollution.

However, it is now facing a grave risk due to the consequences of climate change. The town is at risk of being buried in sand by the progression of desertification, potentially resulting in the loss of invaluable cultural and historical heritage. Copernicus is a valuable tool for monitoring the progression of desertification as its Sentinel Satellites provide accurate detection of environmental changes over time, enabling timely mitigation measures to be taken to protect the environment."
"climate-change-affecting-icelandic-coastline"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 21 April 2022, shows the village of Höfn on the southeastern coast of Iceland. It is a fishing town with just over two thousand inhabitants located on one of the few natural harbours of the region and near the Vatnajökull, Iceland’s largest ice cap. As a consequence of climate change, the lagoons surrounding the village are becoming shallower, as the sea level is decreasing. This phenomenon is mainly due to the melting of glaciers: the intense pressure applied on the soil by the nearby ice caps for thousands of years has been diminishing, causing the land to bounce back. Moreover, large glaciers have a gravitational effect on the ocean, pulling water towards them: this decreases as their mass shrinks. These processes have resulted in the tide hitting the shore with less intensity than before, causing the very channels used by fishing boats to fill up with sand. Measurements have shown that the ground in Höfn has been rising by as much as 1.7 centimetres per year. The reduced navigability of the lagoon is affecting fishing opportunities for local fishermen, having a significant impact on the local economy. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides access to state-of-the-art and quality assured climate information. In addition, data collected by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellites are extremely useful for analysing sea-level rise and assessing the effects of climate change has on it."
"climate-change-and-drought-threaten-camargues-wetlands"	"The French region of Camargue is notorious for the wetlands of the Rhône Delta and a rich tradition of bull ranching. But climate change is threatening Camargue’s population and economy. The sea level around the town of Saintes-Marie de la Mer has risen by 3.7 millimetres per year from 2001 to 2019, resulting in the contamination of the soil with salt and leaving the land barren and unhospitable. Decreasing snowfall, and therefore snowmelt, is reducing the Rhône’s flow to Camargue, providing less and less fresh water. This image, acquired by one of the Sentinel-2 satellites on 5 November 2022, shows the town of Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer and the surrounding wetlands, which are threatened by the rising water level. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor drought impact."
"climate-change-and-unsustainable-land-use-practices-threaten-lake-turkana"	"Lake Turkana is a large lake in east-central Africa and a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in northwest Kenya. Its extent has increased by over 10% in the last decade, submerging almost 800 square kilometres of land. According to the Government of Kenya and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the rising water levels in Lake Turkana are caused by climate change and unsustainable land use practices. These two images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 January 2016 (left) and 5 February 2022 (right), show that the village of Komote, located in the southern part of the lake, was turned into an island after the lake level rose in 2020. Data collected by Copernicus satellites allow to monitor of the effects of climate change in fragile ecosystems such as wetlands, lakes, etc."
"climate-change-threatening-urban-green-spaces"	"According to a new study recently published on Nature, climate change is likely to severely affect urban green spaces and trees, which bring a range of positive effects on life in urban environments. For example, green areas have a cooling effect, making heat more bearable in cities. The study found that the majority of trees in urban environments across the globe is likely to be put under great stress because of raising temperatures and drier soil conditions. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 21 September 2022, shows the Australian city of Darwin and its surroundings, where the proportion of urban tree species expected to be at risk is among the highest. Open data from Copernicus Sentinel satellites can be used to monitor key parameters of the status of green areas in cities around the world."
"climate-change-threatens-corals-western-indian-ocean"	"On the eastern coast of Africa, a 12,000 square kilometre area of coral reefs ecosystems has been identified to be at risk of collapsing by 2070 due to increasing ocean temperatures and overfishing. This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on23 November 2021, shows some of the coral reefs in the Mafia Island Marine Park, a marine protected area southeast of the island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The area has been declared a reserve after declining fishing stocks were reported due to overfishing and habitat destruction. According to a new study published in the Nature Sustainability scientific journal, coral reefs in the western Indian Ocean are at risk of extinction. Analyses of the reefs in the region, which account for approximately 5% of the global total, has revealed historic changes in the extent and functioning of the ecosystem, as well as the impact of rising sea temperatures. The results show that, at regional level, the western Indian Ocean reefs can be classified as critically endangered around the islands, and vulnerable in coastal areas. Data from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites support the mapping of coral reef habitats, water quality, bathymetry (the study of ocean and lake floors), and the monitoring of fishing activities in coastal waters – a key indicator for coral reef health assessment around the globe."
"climate-change-threatens-glaciers-himalayas"	"The Karakoram range in the Himalayas is renowned for its glaciers, some of which are among the largest and longest outside the polar regions. As a result of climate change, these glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate, leading to the formation of new glacial lakes in the Hunza River basin and in other valleys of the range, as seen in this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image of 15 April 2023. A recent article published in the Nature scientific journal highlights the critical dependency of the Hunza River basin on frozen water resources and warns that future changes in the hydrological regime in this area could have serious consequences for the water flow of the Indus River. Copernicus provides satellite data and services that enable the monitoring of glaciers, including their size, shape, and movement over time."
"climate-change-threatens-helsinki-finland"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 May 2023 shows Helsinki, the capital of Finland.

"cloud-free-sentinel-view-carpathian-mountains"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 10 May 2021, shows a cloud-free view of the Carpathian Mountains. The Carpathians are a mountain range in Central and Eastern Europe, that spans over seven countries (Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine, Romania and Serbia). They are a biodiversity hotspot and home to more than 4,000 endemic species. The range also includes one of the best-preserved primary forests in Europe, 290 square kilometres of which were declared a World Natural Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2007. The area is also protected by the Carpathian Convention, a United Nations initiative for the protection and sustainable development of the area, as well as under numerous European Union nature and biodiversity conservation legislations. The open data from the Copernicus programme are particularly useful for forest monitoring and management. For example, data released daily by the Sentinel satellites offer the opportunity to monitor the health of forests, while data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service provide high-resolution geodata particularly suitable for forest management."
"cloud-free-view-and-sea-surface-temperature-adriatic-sea-europe"	"These two images, obtained from data retrieved by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission on 25 April 2021, show a cloud-free view of Southern Italy (left) and the sea surface temperature of the Adriatic Sea to the east (right). The absence of cloud cover clearly shows colder water (temperature below 14°C) flowing from the northern Adriatic Sea and meandering along the Italian coast in a narrow stream, whereas water of higher temperatures (above 15.5°C) can be found near the Balkan coast. During the winter of 2021, significant anomalies in sea surface temperature have been observed in this part of the Adriatic Sea. According to the latest sea surface temperature report issued by the Mediterranean Center for Environmental Studies (CEAM), the mean temperature anomaly observed in the Mediterranean basin during February 2021 was 0.9°C, and the seasonally adjusted sea surface temperature trend anomaly reached its highest value since recording began in 1982, 1.4°C. The global sea surface temperature trend in the Mediterranean basin determined using data up to February 2021 equals 1.26°C. In the Adriatic Sea, the observed sea surface temperature trend anomaly in February was only slightly above 1°C. One of the objectives of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is to accurately measure sea and land surface temperature using the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument. Coupled with the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL), the SLSTR provides accurate and reliable measurements that support oceanic, environmental and climate monitoring efforts."
"cloud-free-view-antarctic-peninsula"	"The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of Antarctica, where scientific and military bases of several countries are located, including those of Argentina, Chile and Great Britain. According to researchers at the Chilean Air Force's Frei Base (Antarctica), 2020 has been the hottest year in the Antarctic Peninsula in the past three decades, with temperatures more than 2 degrees Celsius over typical values for the area. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 9 February 2020, shows a rare cloud free view of the northernmost part of the Antarctica peninsula, a few days before that the record temperature of 20.75 ° C was reached on Seymour Island. Launched in 2016 and 2018, the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are looking at our oceans, land, ice, and atmosphere to better understand and monitor large-scale global dynamics and to provide critical information for climate change."
"cloud-free-view-france"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 29 March 2021, shows a cloud-free view of France. The atmosphere is completely devoid of clouds due to a high-pressure system currently hovering over the region. In France’s southwestern towns of Biscarrosse and Capbreton, temperature records for the month of March have been broken with 27.4°C and 27.5°C, respectively. Meanwhile, the UK’s Meteorological Office has indicated that temperatures in the south of England could come close to records dating back to 1884. Each month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) publishes a Climate Bulletin with analyses of current climate conditions using critical climate change indicators, including the surface air temperature and temperature anomalies."
"cloud-free-view-ireland-and-western-great-britain"	"On 2 April 2021, the high pressure system that persisted over central and northern Europe made it possible for the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) instrument onboard one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites to capture a rare, almost cloud-free, view of Ireland and western Great Britain. The image shows, in addition to the bright green vegetation, the southern part of Ireland affected by a Saharan sand cloud that reached the area after travelling more than 3000 km in less than five days. Launched in 2016 and 2018, the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites monitor our oceans, land, cryosphere, and atmosphere on a daily basis and enable us to better observe and understand large-scale global dynamics."
"cloud-free-view-italy-april-2022"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentienel-3 satellites on 11 April 2022, shows a cloud-free view of Italy. The image highlights the deficit of snow on the Italian slopes of the Alps (which, according to the Copernicus European Drought Observatory report, have experienced a deficit in snow cover of around 40% compared to reference values) and the absence of vegetation in the Po Valley caused by the drought ongoing in Italy."
"cloudless-view-greece-north-macedonia-and-parts-republic-turkiye-bulgaria"	"On 3 March 2021 Greece was affected by a series of intense earthquakes, the strongest of which hit with a magnitude of 6.3 and an epicentre near Elassona, at an estimated depth of 10 kilometres. According to media reports, nearby cities suffered infrastructural damage and walls in numerous older buildings were damaged or collapsed. As a consequence of the structural damage and due to the fear of aftershocks, which did take place on 3 and 4 March, thousands of people spent the night outside of their homes, as the authorities set up tents and outdoor meal counters. Data supplied by Copernicus satellites and services can help better understand the dynamics of earthquakes and accurate mapping of the resulting damages, allowing for an efficient response in disaster-stricken regions. This image, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 4 March 2021, shows a cloudless view of Greece and North Macedonia, as well as parts of Republic of Türkiye, Bulgaria and Albania. After the period of record snowfalls that blanketed Southeast Europe in February, the air pressure in the region has been at a persistent high, allowing for exceptionally clear views of the region from space"
"cloudless-view-iceland"	"Iceland is Europe's second largest island. You will find it at the southern tip of the Arctic Circle. Even though it is so close to the Arctic, Iceland has a surprisingly mild climate, because the tail end of the Gulf Stream Current carries heat with it through the Atlantic Ocean from the Southern Tropics. And the intersection of two tectonic plates below Iceland give rise to a high level of volcanic activity. The warmer waters and volanic activity, two climatic conditions unique to this area, make it difficult to obtain cloudless images of Iceland from space, making this image of the island, taken by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 17 May 2020, a rare capture. The shot lets you see the exact boundaries of Iceland’s four permanent ice caps: Langjökull and Hofsjökull located within the interior west; Mýrdalsjökull on the southern coast, and Vatnajökull on the eastern coast. Vatnajökull is the largest of the four ice caps and rests on top of three active volcanoes, including the Grímsvötn Volcano, which has been showing signs of unrest during the past few weeks. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide data to study our land, ice, oceans and the atmosphere to provide a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of our Earth."
"cloudless-view-ireland"	"The high pressures that characterised Northern Europe in the first weeks of April 2020 allowed the OLCI instrument (Ocean and Land Colour Imager) onboard one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites to acquire on 15 April a stunning (and rare) almost cloud-free view of Ireland. In the image the lush green vegetation is visible as is a cloud front along Ireland’s north-western coast. Launched in 2016 and 2018, the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are looking at our oceans, land, ice, and atmosphere to better understand and monitor large-scale global dynamics and to provide critical information for marine operations, and more."
"cloudless-view-ireland-first-day-meteorological-spring"	"The high pressures that characterised Northern Europe at the end of February 2022 allowed the OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Imager) instrument carried by of one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites to acquire on 1 March 2022 a rare, almost cloud-free, view of Ireland, as it is usually covered by clouds during this time of year. This image shows the local lush vegetation and the multiple sediment plumes generated by the extra-tropical storms that have recently affected the area."
"cloudless-view-northern-italy"	"The pandemic caused by COVID-19 is heavily affecting Northern Italy. The Lombardia, Emilia Romagna and Piemonte regions remain the areas with the largest number of victims in the whole of Europe. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite on 3 April, shows a cloudless view of the area most affected by the pandemic. For this area, the Copernicus EMS service was activated by the Italian Civil Protection Department for providing maps identifying temporary health facilities (such as triage facilities, field hospitals and so on) as well as gathering places. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) mapping component consists of a set of mapping services funded by the European Union."
"cloudless-view-northern-spain"	"The Spanish regions of Madrid and Catalonia are among the European regions most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Numerous initiatives have been put into place throughout Europe and many teams are working hard to put European space technologies at the service of management and mitigation of the pandemic (apps, Hackathons etc).

"coastal-erosion-eating-away-coastline-atafona-brazil"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 October 2021, shows the coastal area around the town of Atafona, Brazil. Atafona, like many other settlements on Brazil’s Atlantic coast, is being affected by the consequences of climate change. However, in Atafona, these effects are particularly pronounced. Every year, the Atafona shore retreats an average of about three metres, with a peak of 30 metres between 2008 and 2009. This retreat is a symptom of coastal erosion, accentuated by extreme weather events. The impact has been significant: to date, more than 500 buildings have been swallowed up by the waves and many more are threatened by the advancing waters. The Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite uses radar to measure sea level rise – one of the consequences of climate change."
"coastal-erosion-poses-threat-atlantic-coasts-france"	"Coastal erosion is rapidly changing the French coastline, particularly in areas along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 February, shows the area of Soulac-sur-Mer, located at the northernmost tip of the Gironde estuary. In this area, beaches are receding at a rate of 2.5 meters per year due to rising sea levels. Recently, an apartment block that symbolised the touristic vocation of the town has been demolished due to its precarious location on a dune just meters from the water. The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service product portfolio includes a Coastal Zones product, which has been developed to allow the monitoring of the complex dynamics of coastal environments and to support actions to mitigate the effects of climate change, and in particular, sea level rise."
"coastal-erosion-threatens-cyrenaicas-cultural-heritage-sites"	"The cultural heritage sites along the coasts of Cyrenaica are of great historical and universal significance, but they are facing a serious threat from coastal erosion caused by climate change. The impact of this erosion is already visible, with some of these sites at imminent risk of damage or loss. Among the most threatened is the ancient port of Apollonia in Libya, imaged by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 April 2023. Thanks to Copernicus, it is possible to monitor the state of these valuable cultural heritage sites, take action to mitigate the effects of climate change and prevent further damage."
"coastal-erosion-threatens-north-frisian-islands"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 March 2022, shows the North Frisian Islands, an archipelago located between Germany and Denmark, in the North Sea. Between the Sylt Island and the mainland, lies the Wadden Sea. This area, together with the mudflats that are exposed during low tides, is part of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. The area is home to a unique biodiversity and is for this reason it has been made into a protected nature reserve part of the Natura2000 network. The mudflats are particularly important for bird migration, as they attract around 12 million specimen each year and constitutes the primary winter habitat of 34 different bird species. The North Frisian Islands, and especially the Sylt Island, are threatened by an erosion process that is rapidly damaging their environment and threatening their biodiversity. The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) work closely together on a comprehensive coastal monitoring service able to address the complex dynamics of coastal erosion."
"coastline-dubai"	"Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf. Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects. In recent years the city has become symbolic for its skyscrapers, in addition to ambitious development projects including man-made islands. The impact of these developments on the environment must be monitored, and the Copernicus free and open data can largely contribute. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 13 May 2020, shows Palm and World Islands, two artificial archipelagos which aim to replicate respectively a palm tree and a world map. The Copernicus Sentinel missions support marine monitoring by providing data on the behaviour, the use, the health of the ocean and the associated coastal zones"
"collapse-conger-ice-shelf"	"In East Antarctica, the Conger ice shelf, with a surface of approximately 1,200 kilometres, has collapsed during the intense heatwave that hit the continent between 15 and 18 March. Ice shelves are extensions of ice sheets floating over the ocean that slow down the flow of inland ice into the ocean, which is the main process responsible for sea level rise. East Antarctica’s climate was previously thought to be stable and not heavily affected by climate change. In fact, an ice shelf collapse had never been registered in the area before, making the Conger ice collapse a historical event: the most significant collapse after 2002, when the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed due to surface ice melt. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 30 January 2022 (left) and 21 March 2022 (right), show the Conger ice shelf before and after the collapse."
"collapse-marmolada-glacier-italy"	"The Marmolada is the highest peak of the Dolomites, a mountain range in the eastern Italian Alps. On Sunday 3 July 2022, a serac (i.e., a pinnacle of ice) of the Marmolada glacier broke loose. The collapse caused a massive avalanche of snow, ice and rocks to hit a hiking path on the mountain’s flank at a time when several people were present. As of 13 July, a total of eleven causalities have been reported by the Italian authorities. The area where the collapse occurred is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 July 2022. Data from Copernicus satellites are key to mapping and monitoring glaciers around the world."
"columbia-glacier-alaska"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 September 2021, shows the Columbia Glacier in Alaska. The glacier is one of the fastest moving in the world and has been closely monitored since the 1980s when a massive glacial retreat was first observed. Since then, the glacier has lost more than 50% of its total thickness and volume, and in 2011 split into two separate glaciers due to accelerated calving and ice loss. The retreat of the glacier contributes to rising sea levels, mostly through iceberg calving. Whilst tidewater effects are a major driver of the ice loss, the rapid retreat of the Columbia Glacier is also attributable to long-term climate-related thinning. Multispectral data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel missions are a powerful tool for studying the effects of climate change around the world."
"consequences-drought-netherlands"	"This visual, composed of two images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 23 August 2021 (left) and 30 August 2022 (right), provide evidence of the severe drought that is affecting the Noordoostpolder in the Netherlands. Noordoostpolder is a predominantly agricultural area. As the 2022 image shows, the area has turned brown due to the absence of vegetation. This condition is common in many parts of the Netherlands. Due to the drought and crop failures, there are problems with the production of animal feed, as well as a lack of water reserves used by the local fauna. The European Drought Observatory of the Copernicus Management Service is closely monitoring the drought in Europe. Full details are available here."
"consequences-heatwaves-summer-2022-alpine-glaciers"	"The extreme temperatures of the summer of 2022 have put glaciers in the Alps under severe threat. According to scientists of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, European glaciers suffered the most severe melting episode ever recorded since 1948 (the year in which the measures began). One of the worst affected areas is Switzerland. As shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 11 September, the melting of the Tsanfleuron glacier this summer revealed an alpine path that had been covered with ice for about 2,000 years. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides high-resolution data that can be used to produce detailed maps of snow and ice in Europe."
"coober-pedy-australia"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 August 2023, shows Coober Pedy, a remote town nestled in the heart of South Australia. Coober Pedy is an opal mining town with a population of around 2,500 people. It faces scorching temperatures that can soar beyond 52°C during the unforgiving summer months. In a remarkable response to this extreme climate, the residents have opted to live underground, seeking respite from the blistering heat. The ever-increasing temperatures around the world are closely monitored by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, providing valuable insights and data to better understand the effects of climate change on our planet."

"coral-reefs-kimberley-region-australia-threatened-climate-change"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 August 2021, shows the Ashmore coral reef in Australia. According to a new study published in the scientific journal Diversity and Distribution, the Ashmore reef and all coral reefs located in the Kimberley region of Australia could face a dramatic loss of biodiversity due to climate change. The species it hosts would not be able to resist the stress caused by rising sea temperatures and, according to the researchers, could fall in some places from 138 species today to fewer than 30 by 2100. The resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites (10 m in multiple bands) allows Copernicus to monitor biological activity and water quality around the world."
"corinth-canal"	"On 13 May 2020, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this cloudless image of the Corinth Canal in Greece. The Corinth Canal is an artificial canal that connects the Gulf of Corinth with the Aegean Sea, cutting the isthmus that separates them in two. It was inaugurated on 25 July 1893, after eleven years of work. It measures 6.3 kilometres in length, just over 24 meters at its narrowest point and has a maximum depth of 9 metres: due to its small size, it cannot be crossed by large merchant ships, but is mainly used for tourist traffic. The combined use of data provided by the satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions provides essential information for maritime surveillance allowing for more efficient and cost-effective use of other security assets, such as patrol aircraft and ships."
"costa-atlantica-reserve-argentina"	"The Costa Atlantica Reserve is a protected area in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. The reserve protects natural habitats and the biodiversity it hosts. In 1995, it became a Ramsar site, recognised as an endemic bird area outstanding for its variety of species. One of its most pristine areas is the El Páramo, a key site for a wide range of migratory birds, serving as final resting and feeding station. It is shown in this false colour image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 September 2022. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide a wide range of open data which are key to monitoring the state of biodiversity around the world."
"crater-glacier-youngest-mountain-glacier-earth"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 December 2021, shows the Crater Glacier, located on Mount St. Helens, Washington State, USA. The glacier, which has developed on the southwest flank of the volcano’s crater, was named the youngest mountain glacier on Earth in 1996. Since then, it has continued to expand, with new measurements putting it at 2.76 kilometers in length and 200 meters of maximum thickness. The ice mass, which surrounds the lava domes, is unique because of the speed at which it formed after the devastating 1980 eruption. Furthermore, Crater Glacier is known for having the highest growth rate of any glacier in the United States, gaining 15 meters of thickness each year, and rapidly advancing – going against the broader global trend of glaciers melting. Open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of glaciers around the world."
"critically-low-water-level-californias-largest-reservoir"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 May 2022, shows Lake Shasta, the largest reservoir in California, USA. As a result of the ongoing drought severely affecting the Western United States, Lake Shasta is currently at approximately 40% of its total capacity, the lowest level recorded in 45 years. This reservoir is the cornerstone of the Central Valley Project Water Supply, a complex water system which was built for the very purpose of protecting the State against debilitating water shortages. Because of the exceptionally low water levels, the water supply to cities and towns served by the Central Valley Project has been reduced to health and safety needs only. The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, which provide drought indicators and early warning for droughts in Europe (EDO) and worldwide (GDO)."
"critically-low-water-levels-moroccos-reservoirs"	"Drought continues to plague Morocco, causing a severe water deficit in its reservoirs. According to the country’s General Directorate of Hydraulics, on 14 June 2022 the overall reservoir fill rate stood at only 31.8%, 17% less than in 2021. In addition, several reservoirs had a residual water capacity of less than 10%. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 21 June 2017 (left) and 15 June 2022 (right), show the effects of water scarcity at the Al Massira reservoir, the second largest in the country, that is currently at 6.3% of its total capacity."

"cyclone-batsirai-course-strike-madagascar"	"This image, captured on 4 February 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, shows cyclone Batsirai shortly after it passed over the French overseas department of La Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa. Batsirai brought torrential rains and extreme winds to La Réunion, with gusts of 200km/h. The rough seas generated by the cyclone also caused an oil tanker to capsize off the southern coast of La Réunion, resulting in an oil spill. Despite the highly adverse meteorological conditions, teams from the department’s fire and rescue service were successful in recovering all eleven members of the tanker’s crew. Using Sentinel satellite data and in situ data, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service Sea Models can be used to evaluate the potential effects and predict the drifts of oil spills through products such as OSERIT for the North Sea, or MEDSLIK in the Mediterranean."

"cyclone-mocha"	"This image, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 14 May, shows Cyclone Mocha before it made landfall along the coasts of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Mocha struck the Bay of Bengal coastlines as a category-four equivalent cyclone, bringing heavy rain, winds of up to 195 km/h, and coastal flooding. Myanmar, particularly the western Rakhine state, experienced significant destruction, with up to 90% of the capital city, Sittwe destroyed. The storm's impact included power outages, fallen trees, disrupted telecommunications, and damage to camps for displaced Rohingya. The Rapid Mapping module of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service has started delivering detailed delineation maps of the flooded areas. All the products will be published here as soon as they become available."
"cyclone-yasa-fiji-south-pacific-ocean"	"Cyclone Yasa is the first named storm of the 2020-2021 season in the South Pacific. It reached Category 5 level on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as it approached Fiji, with wind speeds of up to 260 kilometres per hour. Only 24 hours ago it was at Category 1. Local officials have warned the potential effects of the storm could be devastating. In addition to winds over 200 km/h, the storm will also bring over 250 mm of rainfall, which could trigger flooding and landslides. The extreme intensity of the storm will cause very rough seas with 14 metre-high waves and storm surges which could bring flooding to low-lying coastal communities. Yasa is the strongest storm of the season so far and it is very unusual that a Category 5 storm develops this early in the season. It could be the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Fiji since Category 5 storm Winston in February 2016. This true colour image has been captured by one of the two Sentinel-3 satellites at 22:01 UTC on 16 December and shows a wide view of Cyclone Yasa as it was getting closer to the Fiji Islands. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are equipped with two optical instruments, the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). The two sensors provide imagery with a daily revisit that enables us to improve our scientific knowledge on atmospheric composition and gather essential information for climate studies and weather forecasting."
"cyclonic-storm-tauktae"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 16 May at 04:47 UTC, shows the eye of Cyclonic Storm Tauktae near the coast of western India. Tauktae is a category 3 cyclone with winds up to 200 km/h. The storm was the most powerful to hit the region in decades. It has formed over the Arabian Sea and is moving north along the coasts of Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat. Due to the rough seas, widespread coastal erosion has occurred in many locations along the coast, forcing the authorities to transfer people to emergency camps. In addition, according to media reports, six people died in Kerala and Karnataka. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission consists of twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) equipped with two optical instruments, the Ocean Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR).

"cyprus-coastline-threatened-oil-spill"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 August at 8:40 UTC, shows a large amount of oil drifting less than 30 km off the northern coast of Cyprus. Following an oil spill in a refinery along the coast of Syria on 24 August, the oil slick first travelled along the Syrian coast before heading towards open seas. Seven days after the start of the crisis, the oil is still floating undisturbed into the Mediterranean and, as this image shows, is now threatening the coast of Cyprus. Data from Copernicus satellite missions as well as models and forecasts (currents, temperature, salinity etc.) from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service are used to predict oil dispersion in case of accidents such as the one that happened in Syria."
"czech-republic-krkonose-national-park"	"Krkonoše National Park is both a National Park and an UNESCO Biosphere reserve in the Czech Republic. It is a unique island of sub-arctic tundra in Central Europe, where lowlands and mountains form a very biodiverse environment, with four different altitudinal vegetation belts.

"dakhla-oasis-egypt"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 2 December 2020, shows the eastern edge of the Dakhla Oasis, one of the seven oases of Egypt's Western Desert. Parts of the villages of this oasis date back to 2000 B.C. while stones from the area were used for the building of pharaoh’s temples. Today, the Dakhla Oasis is the most highly populated oasis in Egypt. Despite the almost total absence of rainfall, it is rich in biodiversity and agricultural practices have expanded significantly in recent years. Residents derive their income primarily from agricultural activities which require abundant water. Thus, the increasing water demand is likely to put pressure on the fossil groundwater resources and limit farming sustainability and expansion in the near future. With a revisit time of five days on average at the equator, the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor the status of the vegetation and support actions for sustainable use of water resources."
"dawson-lambton-penguin-colony-antarctica"	"Emperor penguins are birds that nest in Antarctica. Unfortunately, penguin’s colonies are located in areas susceptible to the effects of climate change. In 2016, the Halley Bay colony, located on the edge of the Brunt Ice Shelf, was destroyed by the collapse of part of the ice shelf, and, according to British Antarctic Survey (BAS) researchers, part of the surviving penguins joined another colony, the Dawson-Lambton colony. Using the “follow the poo” proxy, which enables to visualise organic material against a background of snow and ice, we are able to monitor the whereabouts of these penguin colonies. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 September 2020, which is the first of the 2020 season, shows the status of the Dawson-Lambton colony: comparing the latest imagery with archive images from 2018, shows that the population of the colony seems to have significantly reduced in 2020. Data retrieved by Copernicus Sentinel missions allows to study fragile Antarctic ecosystems. For example, in Antarctica there are at least 61 colonies of emperor penguins, of which 11 were discovered in the summer of 2019 thanks to the use of Copernicus Sentinel-2 data."
"deadly-earthquake-strikes-turkiye-and-syria"	"A devastating earthquake hit Türkiye at 4 a.m. local time on Monday 6 February 2023, with its epicentre 23 km east of Nurdagi, in the Gaziantep province. With a magnitude of 7.8, it is considered one of the strongest earthquakes to affect Türkiye in over a century. Hundreds of buildings collapsed in Türkiye and Syria due to the powerful quake shocks, causing thousands of injuries and the death of more than 640 people, according to official statements released at 10 am on 6 February. Rescue operations are ongoing to assist the hundreds of people who are believed to still be trapped under rubble. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 25 January 2023, shows the location of the earthquake’s epicentre. In an immediate response, the European Union has mobilised search and rescue teams for Türkiye following the activation of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Several Urban Search and Rescue teams are being dispatched from various European countries, and the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre is in direct contact with the authorities in Türkiye to coordinate further support if required. Additionally, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) has been activated to support the assessment of the consequences of the earthquake in Türkiye through the provision of emergency mapping."
"deadly-landslide-jade-mine-hpakant-kachin-state-myanmar"	"On 2 July a massive landslide caused at least 162 fatalities amongst miners that were working in a jade mining site in the state of Kachin, in Myanmar. A landslide triggered by heavy rain sent a wave of mud and rock towards jade pickers working in the pits. Myanmar is the world's largest producer of jade, and even if dangerous landslides occur almost every year during the rainy season in the vast mining sites in Kachin state, last month's landslide was the deadliest on record. This image shows the mine site impacted by the landslide as captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 August, when the first cloud free view of the scene since the day of the accident has been acquired. It is clearly visible that the rock and mud from the landslide poured into the lake formed as a consequence of strong rains typical of the monsoon season. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, provides multispectral imagery with 13 different spectral band at a maximum spatial resolution of 10m. These multispectral data allow to implement effective landslide mapping applications with a combined processing of images capturing the area of interest before and after the landslide event."
"deadly-landslides-petropolis-brazil"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 17 February 2022, allows us to observe the multiple landslides that have occurred in Petropolis following the catastrophic floods that hit the Rio de Janeiro state in Brazil. To date, the official death toll caused by the torrents of floodwaters and the mudslides which have devastated the city has risen to 117 causalities, and local officials indicate that dozens of people are still missing. Operations to evacuate areas at risk and track down missing people are ongoing. The high-resolution open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites allows to accurately delineate the extent of a flood and can be used for damage assessment."
"deception-island"	"On 17 March 2023, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this rare cloud-free image of Deception Island. Deception Island is an active volcanic caldera located in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. It has long been the focus of intense interest from both tourists and researchers because of its remarkable geology and unique ecological characteristics. The island, boasts a horseshoe-shaped caldera, a distinguishing feature formed by a large volcanic eruption approximately 10,000 years ago. This caldera creates a unique sheltered harbour that has previously served as a natural haven for whaling and sealing ships . Moreover, the caldera's shape provides a protective barrier from strong winds and currents, creating a microclimate that supports a rich and diverse ecosystem."
"decline-quelccaya-glacier-peru"	"The Quelccaya glacier in the Andes of Peru can be seen in this image, captured on 30 November 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. The Quelccaya glacier, which was once the world's largest tropical ice cap, has been reduced its volume by nearly 50% over the past four decades and is rapidly melting at a rate of about 5% per year as a result of climate change. The decline of the the health of the glacier has had a significant impact on the people of the nearby community, who rely on it for their water supply and livelihoods. The Copernicus satellites play a crucial role in the monitoring of glaciers worldwide, providing essential information which helps researchers and decision-makers develop effective strategies for addressing the challenges stemming from climate change."
"deforestation-brazil"	"From the 1940s onwards, massive areas of the Amazon basin forests in Brazil were cleared for agricultural purposes. Over the past few years, the deforestation process has been escalating. At the beginning of May 2020, Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (INPE) stated that between January and April 2020, a total of 1,202 sq km had been wiped out, specifying that in April 2020 the cleared area almost doubled compared to the 2019 figures. This picture compares two images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 19 May 2019 and 10 May 2020 in the area southeast of Porto Velho, showing the deforested surface in 2020. The high revisit frequency of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites supports the attempts to mitigate deforestation by providing greater opportunities to acquire cloud-free optical data. This will be of particular benefit at tropical latitudes, where heavy cloud cover has previously delayed the potential acquisition of a complete catalogue of data."
"deforestation-mato-grosso-brazil"	"The Amazon rainforest in Brazil is one of the most biodiverse biomes of the world. Although is considered vital in slowing global warming, it is threatened by deforestation. The statistics published by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) show that Brazil’s Amazon has suffered its worst rate of deforestation in 12 years with 11,088 km² of the rainforest - equivalent to 14.05 times the size of New York City - lost between August 2019 and July 2020. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 on 4 October 2020, shows the province di Aripuanã in Mato Grosso, one of the most devastated areas in Brazil by the recent escalation of the deforestation. The high spatial resolution and the high revisit frequency of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allow the accurate mapping of newly deforested areas."
"deforestation-mexico"	"Forests are essential to our lives. After oceans, forests are the largest storehouses of carbon. They are critical in the fight against the climate crisis. A new study by the World Wildlife Fund, has identified 24 ""deforestation fronts"": they are hot spots where global deforestation has been clustered, causing 43 million hectares of forests loss between 2004 and 2017 (i.e. nearly the size of California or twice the size of UK). This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 30 December 2020, shows the northern part of the “Maya Forest front”, in the northern part of the State of Yucatán, in Mexico, one of the fronts identified by WWF. The high revisit frequency of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites supports the attempts to mitigate deforestation by providing greater opportunities to acquire cloud-free optical data."
"degradation-air-quality-india-october-2021"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 21 October, shows smoke engulfing the skies of northern India. India's air quality in autumn is heavily affected by stubble fires, the intentional burning of straw stubble residues after the harvesting of grains. According to data from India’s Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 2021 agricultural fire season is the least active in five years. However, as this image shows, smoke covers the northern part of India and has degraded the air quality in the capital New Delhi. Complementing Copernicus satellite data, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) monitors and forecasts air quality on a global scale by assessing the concentration of air pollutants and modelling their transport and dispersion."
"degradation-northern-italys-air-quality-october-2022"	"Autumn is usually associated with a deterioration of air quality in some parts of Europe. One of these areas is northern Italy as the alpine arc tends to trap pollutants in the Po Valley. These two images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 (above) and Copernicus Sentinel-5P (below) satellites show that on 18 October 2022, a thin aerosol layer and high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) were present throughout the Po Valley (despite being high, NO₂ values are in line with those measured in 2021 at the same time of year). These environmental phenomena are caused by the presence of a strong high pressure system that has affected atmospheric circulation and caused widespread deterioration of air quality. More information on autumn air quality issues in the northern hemisphere can be found in an article published by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service."
"delta-plain-medjerda-river-tunisia"	"As a consequence of climate change and the ongoing rise of the global sea level, the arid coasts of North Africa are experiencing pronounced shoreline retreats and coastal flooding. Along the 4,633 km coastline that extends from the Gulf of Tunis to the Nile Delta, deltaic and sandy beaches exhibit some particularly interesting dynamics due to anthropogenic and climate change-related factors that increase their vulnerability to coastal hazards. According to a study recently published in the Scientific Reports journal, 47% of North African coasts have a high or very high vulnerability as a result of anthropogenic drivers such as damming and the rapid urban growth of the past decades, and not (only) global warming. The densely populated river deltas in Tunisia and Egypt are particularly vulnerable to coastal hazards, the environmental consequences of which affect crop yields and result in increased migrations from the affected regions. This image, acquired by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 20 January 2021, shows the northern side of the Medjerda River delta plain in Tunisia, which is one of the regions analysed in the newly published study. To better observe the shoreline retreat and the deterioration of the river’s coasts, the study authors used Sentinel-2 images captured in 2019 and compared them to aerial photographs and Landsat-5 imagery of the same region, taken in the 1970s. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, allows users to monitor and study coastal zones and wetlands globally, with a maximal spatial resolution of 10 metres and an average revisit time of five days at the equator."

"desert-dunes-may-be-affected-climate-change"	"This image, taken on 1 January 2022, shows dunes near crop fields in Sharq El Owainat, Egypt. The sand dunes in this part of the Saharan desert are shaped in a northeast-southwest pattern by the wind. According to scientists at King's College London, climate change could induce a rotation of the prevailing winds in this area. This change would cause the dunes to shift from west to east, and in the worst-case scenario, threaten the cultivated fields in this area of the northern Sahara. Data acquired by the Copernicus satellites allow accurate imaging of atmospheric particulate matter, including desert dust. These data enable scientists to improve modelling of both climate change and air quality."
"desertification-and-land-degradation-aral-sea-region"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 12 April 2021, shows the Aral Sea region in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, once the fourth largest lake in the world. As the Sentinel-3 image shows, the Aral Sea has now largely dried up, in part due to intensive cotton farming activities in the region. To address the challenges of land degradation and desertification in the Aral Sea region, the Global Disruptive Tech Challenge 2021 for land restoration was launched by dozens of international organisations. At the beginning of April 2021, four projects were awarded the grand prize in a virtual ceremony hosted by the World Bank. The winning projects focus on agriculture and land management, sustainable forestry, socio-economic development, as well as information and knowledge sharing. They will receive mentorship and support for the realisation of their contributions to restoring the environment in the Aral Sea region. Data acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites can be used to monitor the dynamics of fragile ecosystems threatened by human activities and the effects of climate change."
"deterioration-air-quality-northern-italy"	"The first fog or low clouds of the month are persisting over the Po Valley, a sign of the arrival of the autumn season. In fact, the current high atmospheric pressure causes a stagnation of air masses, the accumulation of humidity and smog in the lower layers of the atmosphere and consequently a deterioration of local air quality. The fog banks which have formed and the high concentration of smog are visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 5 October 2022. Complementing Copernicus satellite data, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) monitors and forecasts air quality on a global scale by assessing and forecasting the concentration of air pollutants, as well as their transport and dispersion."
"devastating-chile-wildfires"	"Severe wildfires are currently raging in central Chile, causing widespread devastation. Over 270,000 hectares have burned, and 24 casualties have been reported. The hot and dry weather conditions, coupled with strong winds, have caused the fires to spread rapidly, making this the second-worst year on record for hectares burnt. Despite the efforts of firefighters and residents, the state National Forestry Corporation reported 275 active fires on 6 February, the day this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image was acquired. Copernicus provides crucial information on the impacts of wildfires thanks to its satellite imagery and data analyses."
"devastating-fires-continue-canada"	"Canada grapples with an unrelenting and devastating wildfire crisis, showing no signs of abating. Alberta continues to be severely affected, with approximately 525,000 hectares of land scorched, making the 2023 fire season the fifth-busiest on record. Unfortunately, the situation is no better in other provinces. This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on May 15th, reveals multiple active fire fronts in Saskatchewan, near Buffalo Narrows and Pinehouse.

"diesel-oil-spill-arctic-circle"	"On 29 May 2020, an accident occurred at a fuel storage near Norilsk, Russia, resulting in a diesel fuel leakage. Over a short period of time, 21,200 tons of fuel leaked into the Ambarnya river. Numerous booms were deployed to prevent the 100 m2 spill from contaminating the Pyasino lake. According to the assessment of Norilsk Nickel, the company owning the fuel tanks, the accident could have been caused by the thawing of permafrost which resulted in the sinking of support posts. Activities began immediately to remove the diesel fuel from the river and contaminated soils. These four images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites show the evolution of the situation: the image of 23 May shows the area before the spill occurred; the image of 1 June shows the diesel (in red) floating in the Ambarnya river; the image of 8 June shows that part of the river has been cleaned up but that the side lakes and canals have been contaminated by diesel; the image of 13 June shows that activities to remove contaminated soils (temporary storage sites appear as white dots) have been undertaken on top of the pumping to remove the fuel from the river. Thanks to frequent acquisitions , Copernicus Sentinels satellites are particularly suitable for the monitoring of disasters."
"diesel-oil-spill-arctic-circle-update-september-2020"	"On 29 May 2020, an accident, caused by the thawing of permafrost, occurred at a fuel storage near Norilsk, Russia, resulting in a signicant diesel fuel leakage. Diesel spilled into the Ambarnya river, and surrounding areas were contaminated. As part of the decontamination of the area, polluted material was stored in temporary sites around the Ambarnya river and removed in early September 2020. The fuel tank from which the leak originated nad been demolished at the beginning of August 2020. Due to the severity of the disaster, numerous independent monitoring activities took place in the area and, according to media, geophysical studies have identified issues that ""cause great concern"" regarding two fuel tanks out of three in Norilsk. This image, acquired on 16 September 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the area of Norilsk. In insert A, the area around the Ambarnya river is pictured and seems completely cleared of contaminated soil temporary storage sites. Insert B shows the Norilsk nickel plant.

"disappearance-glaciers-pyrenees"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 August, shows the Aneto glacier in Spain. Aneto is one of the last remaining glaciers in the Pyrénées mountain range. According to recent research published in the GRL scientific journal, glaciers in the Pyrénées have lost about 23 % of their volume in the last decade, as a result of the topographic conditions of the glaciers (slope, exposure, etc.) combined with an increase in air temperature that in the region has reached +1.5°C since the beginning of the 19th century. According to the scientists who authored the study, this combination of factors will lead to the disappearance of all the major glaciers in the Pyrenees in the coming decades. Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. Copernicus, with its open data, offers unique possibilities to study its effects on the most diverse environments, such as glaciers, oceans, landscapes etc."

"disastrous-floods-brazil"	"Heavy rains lashed north-eastern Brazil last week, triggering multiple landslides on Friday 27 May 2022. The local population was heavily affected: as of 2 June, 120 causalities have been reported and more than 7,300 people have been left homeless. Operations to track down missing people are still ongoing and heavy rains are forecasted to further affect the region. This image, acquired on 1 June 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the significant river discharge caused by the heavy rains near Recife in the State of Pernambuco, one of the most severely affected areas. Deadly flooding and mudslides have already affected Brazil over the past year: in February, more than 100 people were killed in Petropolis, in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Climate change is widely believed to contribute to more intense rainfall, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has classified Recife’s metropolitan region as one of the world’s most vulnerable urban areas. Copernicus data and services are key to monitoring flooding events and assessing their consequences. For example, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO) has published this map of the ongoing Brazilian floods and landslides. It was produced using the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) product of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS)."

"dust-over-red-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 8 July 2021, shows a dust plume that blew off across the Red Sea. Dust plumes are common in the Red Sea. Sometimes, as visible in this Sentinel-3 image, they take on spectacular shapes due to a combination of atmospheric and topographical conditions. In this case, the plume emerges from the Tokar River delta in Sudan, driven by strong inland winds which are common at this time of year. Dust plumes not only have an important effect on air quality. They also play an essential role in the balance of the marine ecosystems of the Red Sea. Dust often gets to deposit in the water, and this provides an essential source of nutrients, which is crucial in an area where nutrient levels are low due to the salinity of the water. Data from Copernicus missions and services can be used to monitor air quality around the world."
"dust-storm-atacama-desert"	"This False Colour image, captured by Sentinel-2 on 24 July 2020, shows the development of a dust storm in the Atacama desert in Chile. The dust went all the way towards the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Argentina and passing over the city of Buenos Aires. This event is different from sand storms originating in the Saharan desert, which usually have a much larger extent due to the difference in soil composition. Dust storms can affect air quality even far away from their origin. With a revisit time of one day, the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite delivers free and open data that can be used for air quality monitoring with global coverage, by exploiting specific data products that are derived from the satellite measurements."
"dust-storm-greenland"	"Even though dust is commonly associated with deserts, significant dust events have also been reported at high latitudes at which winds are occasionally strong enough to send plumes of sediment along the coasts. This phenomenon has been observed often in Greenland: The dust there emanates mainly from glacial flour, a fine-grained silt formed by glaciers grinding and pulverizing rock. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 October 2020, shows a dust storm in the peninsula of Nuussuaq, Greenland. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in land surfaces in high detail at Northern latitudes and to aid in monitoring melting glaciers."
"dust-storm-greenland-october-2021"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 October 2021, shows a dust storm in western Greenland. The phenomenon is only observed at this time of year. It is caused by strong winds carrying glacial flour – a fine silt generated by the glacial erosion of rocks. The Sentinel-2 image shows a dust cloud that has travelled more than 85 km down a fjord north of Sisimiut, before reaching Davis Strait. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes on the Earth's surface in great detail at northern latitudes and to help monitor the melting of glaciers."
"dust-storm-sahara"	"Dust storms are common in the Sahara in early winter. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 1 December, shows a plume rising over the Bodele depression, the site of a vast ancient lakebed in Chad. The plume seen on 1 December is so long that it reaches modern Lake Chad, more than 250 km away. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow accurate imaging of atmospheric particulate matter, including emissions from wildfires or desert dust. These data enable scientists to improve modelling of both climate change and air quality."
"dust-storms-namib-desert"	"On 17 July 2020, several plumes of dust from the Namib desert were streaming westward off the coast of Namibia, as shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image. The Namib desert stretches hundreds of kilometres along the coast of Namibia. Its geological features are very different on each bank of the Kuiseb river. To the south of the river, there are gigantic sand dunes, while to the north, the desert is largely made up of gravel plains and rocky hills. Most dust storms originate from the northern part of the desert, where light sand and dust is blown by inland winds, while the dunes in the south tend to be made of heavier sand. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow accurate imaging of atmospheric particulates, including emissions from wildfires or desert dust: these data will enable to improve modelling of both climate change and air quality."
"dutch-agriculture-netherlands"	"On 4 December 2020, the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO) has been officially launched. Over the next two years it will become a dynamic and inclusive platform and support policymaking by providing new knowledge and data, not only for the scientific community but also for the soil user community and the European Commission services. Soils play a key role in regulating the Earth’s climate, but they are being degraded by unsustainable land use, together with growing population pressure, changes in consumption patterns and increasingly by extreme weather events. Their monitoring can become a key factor in the Green Deal for Europe. For these reasons, sustainable soil management is one of the main objectives of the EUSO, that will grow its content over the coming months. This true colour image that has been acquired by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission. It shows the two opposite sides of Noordoostpolder and Eastern Flevopolder, in the Dutch province of Flevoland, that are connected by the Ketelbrug bridge. Flevoland is located in the centre of Netherlands and is the main agricultural production region in the country, which is the third largest agricultural exporter in the world. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel2-A and Sentinel-2B and provides multispectral data with 13 different spectral bands and a maximum spatial resolution of 10 metres. With its global coverage and 5 days revisit frequency, it allows the development of new applications for regional to global agriculture monitoring."
"early-algal-bloom-baltic-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 June 2021, shows a massive algal bloom in the Baltic Sea. Algal blooms usually occur in the Baltic Sea in mid-summer. As this Sentinel-2 image shows, at the beginning of June 2021 a large bloom was already present around the island of Gotland in the southern Baltic Sea. This early bloom was probably triggered by the heat waves that affected the area during the spring. According to data published by the Danish Meteorological Institute, positive sea temperature anomalies of more than 4 degrees compared to the 1985-2000 average have been recorded in this part of the Baltic Sea. The resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allows Copernicus services to monitor marine biological activity and water quality around the world."
"early-blossoming-almond-trees-southern-spain"	"This image, acquired on 12 February 2023, shows part of the province of Málaga in southern Spain, which is renowned for its almond groves. In this area an early blossoming of almond trees is ongoing. Since it is still winter, the flowers are vulnerable to frost, which puts the summer harvest at risk. A poor almond harvest can have serious economic implications for this part of Andalusia, as Spain is among the largest exporters of almonds in the world. The High-Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity product of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service provides detailed information on vegetation growth, productivity, and seasonal changes. It can be used to support land management and environmental assessments."
"early-signs-coral-bleaching-observed-redang-island-malaysia"	"Early signs of coral bleaching observed in Redang Island, Malaysia The consequences of record-breaking sea temperatures in recent months are becoming increasingly evident, particularly coral bleaching. The early signs of this phenomenon have been observed in Redang Island, Malaysia, which is visible in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 May 2023. The Malaysian government has been closely monitoring the coral reefs and efforts are underway to protect these ecosystems through conservation initiatives and appropriate management responses. Data from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites support the mapping of coral reefs habitats, water quality and are vital for coral reef health assessment and monitoring around the globe."
"earthquake-east-anatolian-fault-zone"	"A devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake has hit Türkiye and Syria. The damage is considerable, with at least 33,000 casualties. The earthquake was so strong that it caused massive ground deformations. This interferogram was created using the radar data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite in ascending orbit on 28 January and 9 February. The areas with the greatest displacement are those close to the Anatolian fault, where analysis of the radar data indicates a displacement along the satellite's line of sight of about 4 metres. The Rapid Mapping module of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service has produced detailed damage grading maps of the areas impacted. All the Rapid Mapping products are available here."
"east-troublesome-fire-area"	"Although the wildfires in California and Oregon have received more attention, the state of Colorado has also been heavily affected by wildfires since July 2020. The state has seen its two largest fires in modern history this year. The Cameron Peak fire, officially the largest in state history, has burned up more than 83,000 hectares (830 km2) of land since mid-August. The second-largest blaze in state history, the East Troublesome Fire, started on 13 October and grew by 56,000 hectares in a single night a few days later. It has burned up more than 77,000 hectares of land and produced a smoke cloud that travelled all the way over to Europe. On 25 October the first snowstorm of autumn arrived in Colorado and provided some relief to the firefighters currently trying to contain the wildfires. In spite of this, firefighters are concerned that the snow will only slow and not stop the fire as it melts away. These images provide a view of the East Troublesome Fire on two different days. The first one, captured on 22 October, clearly shows the wildfire’s hotspots inside the burned area. The second image, which was captured on 27 October, is a natural colour image in which it is possible to see the wildfire area completely covered by snow. Both images have been captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, using data retrieved from the OLCI and SLSTR sensors. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are equipped with 3 main instruments. Besides a SAR RADAR Altimeter (SRAL), two optical sensors are also onboard: one of them is the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) with the primary objective of screening the ocean and land surfaces to harvest biological information (e.g. phenology of marine and terrestrial biomass). OLCI also provides reliable information on Earth’s atmosphere. The other is the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer that provides many applications for both the land and marine domain, such as retrieving Land Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Temperature or to detect and quantify actively burning fires through their emitted radiation signals (Fire detection and Fire Radiative Power data products)."
"eastern-united-states-covered-snow"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 4 January 2022, shows snow cover in the states of Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky following a severe winter storm that affected broad swathes of the eastern USA in early January 2022. The storm, which brought heavy snowfall, caused severe disruption. More than 500,000 people were left without power, thousands of motorists were stranded on highways, and five people have sadly lost their lives. In Washington DC, about 20 cm of snow were measured and many offices of the federal government were closed. Data captured by the Copernicus satellites are particularly valuable for monitoring and mapping snow cover around the world."
"ebro-river-delta-spain"	"In January 2020, Storm Gloria devastated one of the Mediterranean’s largest wetlands, the Ebro river delta in Spain. The storm surge swept 3 km inland, inundating rice paddies with sea water and destroying coastal features. Three months later, severe damage to the southern dune area is still clearly visible in this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image acquired on 25 April. Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a two-spacecraft satellite mission used to deliver data that improves knowledge about disasters and climate change."
"effects-alex-storm-southern-france-and-north-western-italy"	"At least two people have died and dozens went missing after powerful storm Alex hit southern France and north-western Italy. A number of villages suffered serious damage with destroyed bridges, road blocks and cuts off communities around the city of Nice in southern France. Nice’s mayor described the extreme event as the worst flooding in living memory. In northern Italy, roads and bridges were swept away by floodwater, while several rivers overflowed their banks. This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 October 2020, shows sediments gushing into the Mediterranean Sea from rivers located in the Nice area (France) and in the ‘Riviera di Ponente’ area (Italy). Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a two-satellite mission that, among many other areas of application, provides information on pollution in lakes and coastal waters."
"effects-arctic-wildfires-arctic-circle"	"During 2019, Siberia faced the worst fire crisis the country has seen in many years. On 31 July 2019, Russian authorities reported that 3 million hectares were on fire, an area roughly the size of Belgium. Wildfires continued until the end of summer, when snow covered all the burn scars. What we see here is a comparison of two images captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites acquired almost a year apart. The first taken on 8 June 2019 and the second on 7 June 2020 after the arctic region of Siberia, along the Lena River was ravaged , by severe wildfire during July and August 2019. Only after 10 months, it is possible to evaluate the real size of burnscar using Earth observation data, allowing us to measure the largest site and maximum length reach of 83 km. The two images have been rendered with a false colour combination of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 bands, including the Short-Wave InfraRed channels that are widely used in vegetation monitoring, as well as in several wildfire monitoring applications."
"effects-climate-change-alpine-glaciers-matterhorn-glacier-switzerland"	"Climate change is threatening Earth’s cryosphere. In the Alps, for example, temperatures have risen twice as fast as the global average between the late 19th and the early 21st century. According to the 2018 IPCC report, the trend of faster warming rates at higher mountain elevations will continue into the middle of the 21st century. New research published in Climate Dynamics, indicates that up to 92% of glaciers in the Alps could be lost by the end of the century due to the effects of climate change. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 August 2020, shows the ‘Matterhorn Glacier Paradise’ - a popular ski resort near Zermatt in Switzerland. It is one of the alpine areas categorised as “destined to disappear” by the researchers. High resolution data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in the environment around glaciers and to monitor their thawing."
"effects-climate-change-are-changing-austrias-wine-industry"	"In the town of Rust, visible in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, wine growers have been experimenting with new grape varieties that are better suited to the changing climate. This innovation is a response to the rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns that have created difficulties for the traditional grape varieties that once thrived in the region. The Copernicus satellites are supporting the effort to adapt by providing free and open data that can be used to monitor climate change and its impact on agriculture."
"effects-climate-change-kebnekaise-glacier-sweden"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 July 2021, shows the Kebnekaise glacier, in Sweden. Sweden’s once highest peak has lost one-third of the mass of its glacier in recent years, while in the last year alone it has lost two metres in height. According to the recent IPCC report, global warming is causing an unprecedented melting of glaciers. According to researchers, the melting away of the Kebnekaise mountaintop glacier is closely related to the rising air temperatures and changing wind conditions, which are a consequence of climate change. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor the impact of climate change on different ecosystems."
"effects-climate-change-vegetation-torngat-mountains-national-park-canada"	"The Subarctic and Arctic biomes are experiencing significant environmental change with widespread implications for the local residents, the vegetation, and the fauna. New research published in Ecosystems assessed the sensitivity of ecological and geomorphological systems to a warming climate in the Torngat Mountains National Park, Canada. Researchers discovered that the area has undergone a significant greening trend over the past four decades and they suggest that it this a direct effect of climate change. Furthermore, it is their assumption that this trend will affect the entire Arctic landscape in the near future, from coastal areas to mountains. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 September 2020 shows the Saglek Fjord, in the Torngat Mountains National Park, one of the newly green areas of Canada. Copernicus satellite data is key for monitoring the impact of climate change on Arctic vegetation."
"effects-drought-extremadura-spain"	"Spain is one of the EU Member States that is most severely affected by the consequences of the historic drought in Europe. In Extremadura, one of the most impacted regions, 15 reservoirs are in an 'emergency state', and numerous water rationing measures are being imposed. The damage to agriculture is considerable due to the water scarcity. In the Vegas Altas valley, an area with a strong agricultural activity located east of Merida, crops have been decimated. The comparison between these two images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites shows that in 2022 the dominant colour in the area is brown, a symptom of the absence of agricultural planting. In contrast, in 2021, green predominated in the area, indicative of a healthy vegetation."
"effects-drought-great-salt-lake-usa"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 July 2021, shows the current state of the Great Salt Lake in the United States In late July 2021, water levels at the Great Salt Lake in Utah reached a historical recorded low, while historically the lake reaches its lowest levels in October. Comparing the water level on the latest imagery with a water delineation derived from Landsat-5 images acquired in August 1985 (red line) shows that the level of the lake has significantly decreased, and several bay areas are now nearly totally dry. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect and monitor water bodies globally."
"effects-drought-lake-guardialfiera-italy"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 September 2021, shows the current state of Lake Guardialfiera in Molise, Italy. At the end of August 2021, the water levels of Lake Guardialfiera reached a record historical low. Comparing the water extent retrieved from Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2017 and 2020 at the same time of year, it can be observed that 2021 saw the lowest level recorded in the last five years. According to the latest ANBI Water Resources Observatory bulletin, the Adriatic regions are experiencing drought conditions, and experts have introduced the concept of ""aridification"" in their bulletins. This dire situation is confirmed by the analysis of drought indicators performed by the European Drought Observatory. Copernicus, the European Union's Earth Observation Programme, includes two Drought Observatories operated by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The Observatories provide drought-related indicators and early warnings for droughts in Europe (EDO) and globally (GDO)."
"effects-drought-lake-mead-usa"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 July 2021, shows the current state of Lake Mead in the United States. Comparing the water level in the latest Sentinel-2 image with an extrapolation from a Landsat-5 image acquired in October 1984 (green line) shows that the level of the lake has significantly dropped in several points, with the coastline retreating by more than one kilometre in 37 years. As of June 2021, the level of Lake Mead has dropped to about a third of its total capacity and is at its lowest point in the lake's history. As a consequence of water levels, cuts in downstream water allocations from the Colorado river are planned for 2022. According to experts, the mega-drought that is affecting the west coast of the United States is driven by climate change and is leading to an irreversible aridification of the territory. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect and monitor water bodies globally."
"effects-drought-vegetation-morocco"	"Morocco is experiencing its worst drought in decades. The winter rainfall levels recorded in 2021-2022 are 64% below the historical average and Moroccan reservoirs are, on average, at only 33.2% of their capacity. Some of the most worrying conditions are observed in the agricultural region of Doukkala, where the Al Massira reservoir is at only 6.7% of its capacity. These two images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 14 February 2021 (left) and 13 February 2022 (right) show the consequences of the severe drought underway in Morocco on the vegetation. The image on the left shows agricultural areas with vegetation in full bloom about a year ago.

"erg-chebbi"	"This false colour image, captured by one of the Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 July, shows the a region of the Anti-Atlas mountain range near the eastern borders of Morocco. This area is known for its ergs – seas of sand dunes – and its outstanding geological features, outcrops and fossils. The centre of this image features Erg Chebbi, one of Morocco's most famous ergs, it appears in many films because of its stunning expanse of iconic fire-orange sand dunes. The Erg Chebbi dunes rise up to 150 m from the surrounding rocky desert and altogether they span an area of 28 km from north to south and up to 7 km from east to west, lining the Algerian border. This breathtaking landscape attracts many tourists and because of its highly mixed lithology, the eastern Anti-Atlas has become a prime area of interest for geological mapping applications using satellite imagery and data. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, composed of twin satellites, provides multispectral data thanks to its 13 spectral bands, with a maximum spatial resolution of 10 m. For this reason, the mission improves the effectiveness and accuracy of the lithological classification of rocks and minerals, making it easier to study and monitor the geological structures of the Earth."

"estuary-micay-river-colombia"	"Mangroves are amongst the most important ecosystems on our planet, they support a high biodiversity and protect our coasts from erosion. They are essential for the mitigation of climate change (carbon sequestration through reforestation and forest preservation) and adaption to its effects (e.g. defence against severe storms). According to a study recently published in the Science of the Total Environment scientific journal, these precious ecosystems are at particular risk of being polluted by plastics carried from rivers to the sea. In particular, fifty-four percent of mangrove habitats around the world are within 20 km of a river that discharges more than a metric tonne of plastic waste into the ocean each year, where it can heavily damage its habitats. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 May 2020, shows the estuary of the Micay River, located in the Esmeraldas-Pacific Colombia mangroves ecoregion, one of the areas identified in the study as being at high risk of plastic pollution.

Among those at risk is the Brewster Glacier, which can be seen in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 March. According to the scientists at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) who monitor the glacier, it has lost its distinctive ""happy, living"" features. The annual snowline survey conducted by NIWA highlights the alarming rate of melting and the fact that it poses a serious threat to the environment, water resources, as well as local communities and wildlife that depend on the glaciers. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are essential tools for monitoring the changing conditions of the world's glaciers."
"glaciers-world-heritage-site-are-threatened-climate-change"	"Glaciers around the world are suffering from the consequences of Climate Change. Their melting is having a disastrous impact on local communities and biodiversity. According to a new study by UNESCO, a third of all glaciers in World Heritage Sites will disappear by 2050 due to rising temperatures. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on XX March 2022, shows the glaciers of Los Alerces National Park in Argentina. The report indicates that the glaciers of the area have lost 45.6% of their mass since to 2000. The data provided by Copernicus satellites make it possible to extract key data on mapping and monitoring glaciers around the world."
"grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam"	"The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, with a total volume of 10 million m3, is the largest dam in Africa. It is located 500 km northwest of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), and is fed by the Nile river. On 21 July 2020, the maximum capacity of the dam reservoir was reached for the first time since its completion. This image, obtained by combining multiple Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite images from 27 June, 9 and 21 July, shows the stages of the reservoir‘s growth. The surface of the reservoir between June 27 and July 9 is shown in red tones, the yellow tones depict the water storage extent between 9 and 21 July. Data obtained by the radar on board Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites allow us to monitor, with very high precision, the surface of reservoirs and to derive the volume of water in storage, as well as to monitor the structural stability of dams."
"great-bahama-bank"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 May 2021, shows the underwater dunes of the Great Bahama Bank in the Atlantic Ocean. The Great Bahama Bank is a large shallow water body located between Great Exuma and Andros islands in the Bahama Archipelago. The sea in this stretch of water has depths of no more than 5 metres. The limited depth of the seabed favours the growth of corals that cover much of the Bank. The marine area also has a considerable ecological value as it supports a complex food chain, as phytoplankton and some valuable species of tuna proliferate in the growing seasons. In 2016, the Bahamas government started a process to protect at least 20% of its marine environment, including the Great Bahama Bank. Built essentially as a land monitoring mission, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are now found to be very useful for a multitude of marine applications such as monitoring coastal waters and coral reefs, bathymetry, detecting marine debris etc."
"great-barrier-reef"	"The Great Barrier Reef is an ecosystem of remarkable variety and beauty on the north-eastern coast of Australia, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981. It contains the world’s largest collection of coral reefs, with 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusc. According to a new study published on the Proceedings of the Royal Society Journal, the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas because of climate change. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 August 2020, shows a portion of the Whitsunday Group, on of the most affected areas in the central part of the Great Barrier Reef. The resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites (10 m in multiple bands) allows Copernicus services to monitor biological activity and water quality around the world."
"greece-flames-monitoring-dervenochoria-wildfire-space"	"Multiple wildfires are currently ravaging Greece, resulting in substantial damage and necessitating the evacuation of residents. This image, captured on the 19th of July by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, reveals the burn scar and smoke plume produced by the ongoing Dervenochoria wildfire in western Attica.

"greening-california"	"These two images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 16 January 2021 and 12 January 2022 (right) provide evidence of greening in California following record rainfall at the end of December 2021. California has been affected by a severe drought which has caused serious damage to agriculture and reduced fresh water supplies in many of the state's reservoirs. As a result of recent rains, drought conditions have improved and vegetation has resumed its growth cycle. The main purpose of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites is to measure sea surface topography using the SRAL instrument, sea and land surface temperature using the SLSTR instrument, and ocean and land surface colour using the OLCI instrument. The three instruments on board the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow for accurate and reliable measurements that support ocean, environmental and climate monitoring."
"greenland-sea-ice-all-time-record-low"	"Arctic sea ice usually reaches its lowest extent of the year in September. In 2021, according to data published by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the extent of Arctic sea ice will be one of the highest in the last decade; however, the distribution of ice is not uniform across the Arctic. Sea ice in the Greenland Sea is currently, in fact, at an all-time record low. This image, acquired by the radar onboard one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 19 September, provides evidence of an absence of sea ice, and therefore open waters, in the Fram Strait, the northernmost part of the Greenland Sea. Open data provided by Copernicus products and services allow for the development of authoritative assessments of the state of sea ice coverage in polar regions."
"greenland-still-struggling-heatwave-consequences"	"Greenland is grappling with a melting ice sheet episode, attributable to the persistent heatwave sweeping across the Arctic. Images from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, captured on 29 June and 3 July, show the changes in snow coverage on Nares Land, a northern Greenland island. The air temperature, about ten °C higher than the average for the period, has led the entire island’s snow cover melting in just four days, exposing the underlying ice cap. Copernicus open data provide invaluable information on the consequences of climate change in the Arctic and Antarctica by frequently monitoring these regions."
"grenen-place-where-two-seas-meet"	"Grenen is the northernmost point of Denmark. This area is protected as a Natura 2000 site under the EU's Habitats Directive, as it is an important migration site for a wide range of bird species. The Grenen area is characterised by a continuously forming double-banked dune system. Two seas meet along the local coast: the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The collision of the currents of the two seas results in beautiful swirls, such as those visible in the image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 February 2022. Every day the Copernicus Sentinel missions and Copernicus Services deliver over 16 petabytes of open data that can be used to monitor natural reserves worldwide."

Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite open data allow to monitor the development and changes in dunes and coastal ecosystems."
"guadalupe-island-mexico"	"This Copernicus Sentinel-3 image acquired on 24 May over Mexico bay, shows several cloud patterns swirling downwind of the Guadalupe Island. These cool patterns are called Von Kármán vortices. Von Kármán vortices typically form when wind impacts elevated land features, such as islands, that disrupt the airflow and produce spiral patterns in the clouds. In addition to Von Kármán vortices, a series of colourful concentric rings, bright red on the outside and blue toward the centre are also visible. They result from a particular optical phenomenon, called gloria, which takes place when water droplets scatter sunlight back toward a source of light. Data derived from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission imagery are essential to improve scientific knowledge about marine pollution and biological productivity, two important indicators of climate change."
"gulf-ajaccio-corsica"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 23 September 2022, shows the largest city in Corsica, Ajaccio. Ajaccio is nestled between the mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. Its gulf has been classified as a Natura 2000 site because of the significant presence of seagrass habitats of Posidonia, many reefs and caves and two marine species particularly valuable, the bottlenose dolphin and the loggerhead turtle. Ajaccio and its suburbs are already facing the effects of climate change. According to the data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the air temperature of the area has been ~0.8°C higher than the reference values in the past ten years. The data provided by the Copernicus satellites and services make it possible to elaborate crucial information on the state of implementation of European policies, including those related to the protection of fragile biodiversity sites."
"haiti-earthquake"	"A devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti. The damage is considerable, with at least 1,297 casualties. The earthquake was so strong that it generated ground deformations. This interferogram was created using the radar data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites in descending orbit on 3 and 15 August. The areas that have had the greatest displacement are those close to the epicentre, where 9 interference fringes are present, corresponding to about 20 cm of displacement along the line of sight of the satellite.

The Park is located in North Germany, in the estuary of the Elbe in the North Sea and is the smallest of the three Wadden Sea National Parks, with an extension of 137.5 km². However, it has the largest proportion of wilderness: over 90% of its total area. The Wadden Sea is almost entirely composed of tidal flats and sand barrier systems, an outstanding example of large-scale development of an intricate temperate-climate sandy barrier coast under conditions of rising sea level. The dynamic natural processes typical of the area operate uninterruptedly, creating its distinctive landscape. The nutrient-rich waters support the reproduction of many species of fish and birds: of the 340 bird species observed in the Hamburg area, 81 species have so far been identified as breeding on the park’s islands. Because of its unique biodiversity, the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park has been designated as a UNESCO biosphere reserve since 1992 and part of the Wadden Sea World Heritage Site since 2011, as well as being protected as a Natura2000 and Ramsar site.

In the same areas, air temperatures reached 27°C. This value represents a temperature anomaly of between 13 and 20 degrees C, depending on sources, above typical maximum daytime temperatures for this time of year in the area. Other regions of Russia are also affected by abnormal temperatures. In the Chelyabinsk region, it the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations recommended to cancel all public events and limit the stay of children in the open air. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) both equipped with the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, an instrument whose main objective is to provide Sae and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) with a very high level of accuracy, for both climatological and meteorological applications."
"heatwave-arabian-peninsula"	"This image, acquired on 25 May 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, shows Qatar and part of the United Arab Emirates in the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian Peninsula and in particular Qatar are affected by a severe heatwave. On the day on which this image was acquired, Qatar experienced the hottest day on record for the month of May. According to the data published by the Qatar Meteorology Department, a record temperature of 48.1°C was reached in Abu Samra, breaking the previous monthly record set in 1986. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission consists of twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, which can measure thermal parameters for both terrestrial and marine environments. This allows to derive information such as land surface temperatures over periods of time and compare them from year to year."
"heatwave-arctic-causes-intense-ice-cap-melting-svalbard"	"The extremely high temperatures recorded in this summer of 2022 are also affecting the Arctic. As of today, 1 August 2022, in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, situated north of mainland Europe, the recorded temperatures are about 5°C higher than the reference values (i.e., in respect to the 1981-2010 average for the same day). This heatwave is causing exceptional levels of ice cap melting, thus contributing to sea level rise. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 July 2022, shows a large sediment discharge in the Arctic Sea, off the coast of Svalbard, caused by the rapid melting of snow and ice. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in the earth's surface with great detail and monitor the effects of climate change on remote environments such as the Arctic region."
"heatwave-causes-unprecedented-glacier-melt-washington-state-usa"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 11 July 2021, shows Mount Rainier National Park in the state of Washington (USA). The record heatwave in the northwestern United States and Canada has caused severe consequences on the West Coast. According to scientists at Washington State University, the glaciers in Washington State have gone through the most severe and rapid melting episode of the last one hundred years. Mount Rainier, the iciest peak in the United States, seen in this image, has lost about 30% of its snowpack as a consequence of the heatwave. In addition to the damage to the glaciers, scientists believe the unusual absence of snow will cause a lengthening and intensification of the fire season across the area. The open data from the Copernicus satellites allow the state of glaciers around the world to be monitored in unprecedented detail."
"heatwave-central-russia"	"This image, acquired on 24 May 2021 by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the city of Yekaterinburg in central Russia. On the day on which this image was acquired, a record temperature of 34.7°C was measured in the city, breaking the previous record that dated back to 1952. This record temperature was caused by a persistent and exceptional heatwave that is affecting Russia, the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula where, on 21 May, a sweltering temperature of 49.6°C was reached. The open data provided by the Copernicus satellite missions enables us to develop a better understanding of the environmental phenomena linked to climate change."
"heatwave-europe"	"A severe heatwave affected Europe on 31 July 2020. The United Kingdom experienced its third hottest day on record, as temperatures reached 37.8C in Heathrow. Record values were also recorded in France, such as 37.9 ° C in Boulogne-sur-Mer. This image shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST – not to be confused with the air temperature) obtained from Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite data acquired on 31 June 2020 at 10:13UTC. LST can be thought of as showing the “skin surface temperatures of the Earth” and in this acquisition, data shows some areas of France’s LST reaching 50°C and United Kingdom 40°C. LST is not considered an essential climate variable, but its high value in the determination of surface energy, water fluxes and interpretation of surface characteristics make this parameter essential for global climate observations, in the context of the ""Global Observation System for Climate"". As a consequence, the LST derived from Copernicus Sentinel-3 Satellites measurements allows a regular assessment of the status of global climate."

A remarkable heatwave in Greenland is causing extensive melting conditions throughout the northern ice sheet. Climate change is having a profound impact on the Earth's polar regions, leading to a rapid rise in temperatures. The Arctic, in particular, is experiencing significant warming, with temperatures increasing faster than the global average rate. This temperature rise is causing the accelerated melting of ice caps, glaciers, and sea ice, leading to rising sea levels and disruptions to ecosystems. The current and upcoming Copernicus Sentinel satellite missions are crucial for tracking how climate change is impacting remote places like the Arctic."
"heatwave-grips-southern-europe"	"One of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite images captured on 16 July 2023 reveals a clear view of Greece without clouds, illustrating the ongoing exceptional heatwave in southern Europe. In response to the extreme temperatures, local authorities in Athens have implemented measures to protect public safety, including restricting access to the Acropolis monument during the hottest hours of the day between 14 and 16 July. The African anticyclone will strengthen over Mediterranean latitudes, encompassing Italy as well, resulting in an exceptional heatwave with maximum air temperatures that will surpass average levels by more than 10 °C and potentially break some absolute temperature records. The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides essential data and insights to understand the impact of ongoing heatwaves worldwide."

"heavy-snowfall-paralyses-japan"	"In the past week, Japan suffered one of the most severe cold spells of the season due to an unusually cold weather formation, which caused heavy snowfall across large parts of the country. The intense storm heavily impacted transport networks, as vehicles and local trains were blocked by the snow with thousands of people inside and flights had to be cancelled due to the weather. The worst affected areas were located in the Southwestern area of Japan, where the city of Maniwa hit with a record 93 cm of snow in just 24 hours. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 January, shows the snow-covered Nemuro peninsula, in northern Japan. Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide free and open data that is used to monitor snow cover, an important driver of many climatic, environmental and economic processes worldwide."

Copernicus Marine data enables comprehensive monitoring and forecasting of sea surface temperatures, providing valuable insights into the changing thermal conditions of the world's oceans."
"high-water-levels-australias-menindee-lakes"	"The Menindee Lakes are a system of 9 lakes in New South Wales, Australia, comprised of four main lakes – Lake Menindee, Lake Wetherell, Lake Pamamaroo and Lake Cawndilla – and several smaller ones, located on the Darling River. Long periods of drought and extended low flow of the river often cause the lakes to run dry. However, due to the intense rain episodes associated with the latest La Niña event, the lakes are now finally refilling. According to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority data, on 2 May 2022, the lakes reached one of the highest levels recorded in the last 10 years. Their status is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellites on 3 May 2022. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, with their multi-spectral instruments, deliver key information to monitor water bodies across the Earth."

"hurricane-danielle-atlantic-ocean"	"The Atlantic Ocean Hurricane season has begun. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 4 September at 13:04 UTC, shows Hurricane Danielle as it was 3,000 km west of the coast of Portugal. It formed in an anomalous position, at about 38° latitude North, and now it is moving towards Europe where it is likely to arrive as a tropical depression. Besides its position, Danielle has another peculiarity. It was named by the US National Hurricane Centre on 2 September, 21 days after the average day on which the first hurricane is named in the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, August 2022 was the first August in 25 years without a single named storm in the Atlantic Ocean."
"hurricane-delta"	"Delta is the 25th named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. On 6 October, Hurricane Delta rapidly intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane with a top wind speed of 210 km/h. According to the US National Hurricane Center, it will maintain its intensity or possibly strengthen before making landfall near Cancún (Mexico). This image acquired on 7 October at 03:33 UTC by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites shows Hurricane Delta during the local night time, as seen by the thermal sensors available onboard the satellite. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission, which consists of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B), is equipped with two sensors, OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea Land Surface Temperature Radiometer). The SLSTR sensor, in particular, allows daily land and sea monitoring with its Short Wave Infrared and Thermal bands."
"hurricane-epsilon"	"Epsilon is to date the tenth hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. The intensification rate has been high, as wind speeds grew from 100 to 180 km/h over a 24-hour period, making it a Category 3 hurricane. It has also been classified as the 4th major hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season after Laura, Teddy and Delta. On top of that, it has already broken the record of the earliest 26th named Atlantic storm of the year, beating out the 26th storm of 2005 that had formed on November 22nd. This true colour image was captured by one of the Sentinel-3 satellites on 22 October while Epsilon was crossing the Atlantic Ocean. It is now nearing Bermuda and is expected to hit the island with life-threatening surf and rip currents according to the latest bulletin of the US National Hurricane Center. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are both equipped with multiple instruments.

It has strengthened very rapidly in a short amount of time, reaching category 4 and winds of 240km/h, according to the American Hurricane Centre (NHRC). Flash floods from rainfall and storm surge are potentially catastrophic. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission provides images with a daily revisit that allows us to improve our scientific knowledge of atmospheric composition and gather essential information for climate studies and weather forecasts."
"hurricane-iota-caribbean-sea"	"Less than two weeks after being hit by Category 4 Hurricane Eta, several Central American countries have had to brace themselves for the arrival of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of potentially devastating storm surges and winds, accompanied by torrential rains. Iota is the strongest hurricane and the 30th named storm of the 2020 Atlantic season. This is the highest number of named storms since modern record-keeping began (the previous record of 28 was set in 2005). It also marked the first time that two hurricanes formed in the Atlantic in the month of November. Additionally, it is the 13th storm to reach hurricane strength this year. Hurricane warnings have been issued for large portions of coastal Nicaragua and Honduras, but the storm could also have a severe impact on Belize and Guatemala. This true colour image was captured by one of the two Sentinel-3 satellites on 16 November at 15:25UTC, when Iota was moving towards Central America and its eye was about 170km from the coast of Nicaragua. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that have been equipped with two optical instruments, the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). The two sensors provide imagery with a daily revisit that enables us to improve our scientific knowledge on atmospheric composition and gather essential information for climate studies and weather forecasting."
"hurricane-laura"	"In the early morning hours of 27 August 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall on the southwestern coast of Louisiana with a ferocity that this region has never witnessed before. The storm, leaping from a Category 1 on 25 August to a Category 4 in the night of 26 August, has reached peak winds of up to 240 km/h. This image, acquired by the SLSTR radiometer of the Copernicus Sentinel-3B satellite on 27 August at 04:00 UTC (11 PM local time), shows a thermal view of Hurricane Laura just before crossing the US coastline. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B), both equipped with a SLSTR Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer. This instrument allows for measurements of the global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) with a very high level of accuracy for both climatological and meteorological applications."
"hurricane-linda"	"The 2021 Eastern Pacific hurricane season began in mid-May. The weather and met-ocean conditions have led to the formation of 12 tropical depressions in only three months. Linda is the fourth storm to be classified as a hurricane, and on 14 August, at 17:32UTC, the time of acquisition of this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image, it was located southwest of the coast of Mexico. With a front more than 700 km wide, the storm is now heading towards Hawaii but is not expected to impact any territory. The data supplied by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission enable improvements in the scientific understanding of the composition of the atmosphere and provide essential information for climate studies and weather forecasts."
"hurricane-nicole-hit-florida"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 10 November at 15:52 UTC, shows Hurricane Nicole. A couple of hours before the acquisition of this image, Nicole made landfall as Category 1 Hurricane in Florida. It caused power outages in more than 200,000 buildings and homes, a state of emergency was declared in one-third of Florida’s territory, and two casualties have been reported. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission comprises two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, which allow us to monitor water quality and sediment transport in coastal areas."
"iberic-peninsula-and-southern-france"	"While weather in the first part of the summer has been generally unstable, western Europe is now affected by the first heatwave of the year. This Natural Colour Image, captured by the OLCI (Ocean Land and Colour Instrument) of a Sentinel-3 satellite on 19 July, shows the Iberian peninsula and southern France with clear skies almost everywhere, because of the high pressure condition and strong solar radiation that have prevailed over the area for about a week. As a consequence, in the last few days, parts of southern Portugal and southwestern Spain have recorded very high temperatures, over 40°C, in some areas. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, that both include the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI ) in their instrument payloads. One of the main application of OLCI is related to atmospheric monitoring, including the possibility to derive the Illumination condition of the observed area or to measure the downwelling solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and top-of-atmosphere."
"ice-arch-nares-strait"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the ice arch formed on 15 June 2020 in the Nares Strait, which separates Greenland and Ellesmere Island (Canada). The ice arches are ice structures which geometry prevents sea ice from exiting the Arctic Ocean and drifting south. Typically ice arches break in early July and then reform in winter. According to a study published in the Nature Communication scientific journal, ice arches have become thinner and every year they break a week earlier than the previous year. In particular, the ice arches are becoming more unstable and this could destabilise the northernmost area called the Last Ice Area, an important refuge for ice-dependent species, from polar bears to icy algae that provide oxygen and nutrients to the ecosystem. The data provided by the Copernicus missions retrieve important information on Arctic ice. For example, data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are the basis of the study quoted herein."
"ice-cap-thawing-season-greenland"	"On 22 June 2020, the season during which the ice sheet loses more mass from melting than it gains from snow, started in Greenland. The Danish Arctic research institutions group published, on its Polar Portal, a map of the areas affected by melting. This map shows that approximately 40 % of the total Greenland ice sheet is thawing, one of the highest values ever recorded in June when comparing to the 1981-2010 average. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 June 2020, clearly shows small melt ponds, which are the result of thawing, scattered across the Avangnardleq and Kujatdleq glaciers. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in the Arctic region."
"ice-extent-lake-st-clair-usa-and-canada"	"The Great Lakes are a series of large interconnected freshwater lakes in the upper mid-east region of North America. The climate of the Great Lakes in winter is influenced by the Polar Vortex. Cold temperatures cause the freezing on average of 53% of the Great Lakes surface, but in 2021, due to a warmer than normal winter, it is not expected to exceed 30%. According to Richard Rood, professor of Climate Science at the University of Michigan, this reduction in the extent of the Great Lakes is due to climate change. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 January 2021, shows that only the southern part of Lake St. Clair, on of the Great Lakes located on the border between Ontario in Canada (east of the image) and Michigan in the USA (west of the image), is covered with the ice. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change at northern latitudes."
"ice-free-arctic-ocean-areas-north-svalbard-archipelago"	"On 8 March 2021, the monthly Sea Ice Bulletin of the Copernicus Climate Change Service for February 2021 reported that the overall sea ice extent was lower than the average for the month, as measured since 1979. In an average February, most of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is covered with sea ice, including large regions of sub-Arctic seas. The average February 2021 Arctic sea ice extent was 14.2 million km², 0.6 million km² or 4% below the 1991–2020 historical average, whereas the lowest February sea ice extent in this region was recorded in 2018, at 7% below the 1991–2020 average. This year, the overall sea ice concentrations appear in a mixture of values above and below average historical concentrations in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic, with most notable positive anomalous concentrations found in the southern Barents Sea, and negative in the southern Bering Sea, the northern Sea of Okhotsk and north of Svalbard. In the North American sector of the Arctic Ocean, concentration anomalies have been found to be mostly negative particularly along the coast of northeast Canada. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 Satellites on 8 March at 10:02 UTC, shows the Arctic Ocean north of the Svalbard Archipelago free of sea ice. It is a rare sight as cloud-free images are scarce in the winter in this region. The map produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service to depict the anomalous absence of Arctic Ocean sea ice in February 2021 is included as an insert. Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are equipped with SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) instruments, which allow for accurate monitoring of sea ice extent, as well as measurements of its temperature. The open data provided by Copernicus products and services enables factual assessments to be made of the state of the sea ice cover around the globe."
"ice-free-coastal-area-chukchi-sea-alaska"	"Following the trend that developed in September and October 2020, the Sea Surface Temperature measured in the Northern Bering and Southern Chukchi seas remained above normal in November. The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratories high resolution data shows an anomaly of up to 3.5°C compared to normal conditions. This anomaly can be both a cause and an effect of the alarming lack of sea ice at this point of the season. Sea ice has an important influence on Earth systems and on the polar environment, influencing oceanic circulation, weather, and regional climate. But the influence of sea ice on the Earth is not just regional, it is global. The ice’s white surface reflects far more sunlight back to space than free ocean water. The more the ice melts and exposes more open water, the more sunlight is absorbed rather than reflected. The sun-warmed water then causes more ice to melt. Over several years, this positive feedback cycle (known as the ice-albedo feedback) can influence the global climate. This image acquired on 23 October 2020 by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission shows a ice-free coastal area in the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic Region of western Alaska. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B), provides multispectral data from 13 different bands with a maximum spatial resolution of 10 metres, provides invaluable support for monitoring the impact of Climate Change on Arctic sea ice extent."
"ice-melting-antarctica"	"At the beginning of February 2020, a heatwave with record-breaking temperatures hit Antarctica. On 6 February, thermometers at the Esperanza Base recorded 18.3°C, and on 9 February 20.75°C was reported at Marambio station - the two hottest temperature on record for Antarctica. This warm spell caused widespread melting of nearby glaciers and parts of the ice cap. This image compares two acquisitions from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites of 13 January and 12 February 2020. In the image from February, you can see melt ponds, sea ice melting and an unusual increase in the turbidity of the water. The process of ice forming and melting is an important indicator of climate change, and Copernicus Sentinel satellites play a vital role in the monitoring activities of Antarctica’s ecosystem."
"iceberg-68a-dangerously-close-south-georgia-island"	"After calving from the Larsen-C Ice Shelf back in 2017, an iceberg named ‘A-68A’ has been drifting undisturbed in the Antarctic Ocean before reaching the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean at the end of April 2020. There, the iceberg started to split and an additional iceberg by the name of A-68C was formed. Following this split, iceberg A-68A continued to drift and, at the beginning of November, was spotted less than 450 kilometres off of the coast of one of the most wildlife-rich islands of the South Atlantic Ocean: South Georgia Island. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 5 November 2020, shows iceberg A-68A getting dangerously close to South Georgia Island. Launched in 2016 and 2018, the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites gather data about our oceans, land, ice, and atmosphere in order for us to better understand and monitor large-scale global dynamics and to provide critical information on climate change."
"iceberg-76"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 14 May 2021, shows Iceberg A-76 in Antarctica. Iceberg A-76 recently calved from the western side of the Ronne Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. With an area of about 4160 km2, a length of 160 km on its longest axis and a width of 26 km on its widest axis, it is currently, according to the U.S. National Ice Center, the largest iceberg in the world. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission consists of twin satellites equipped with a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument that provides data that is not affected by the presence of clouds, or by the long seasonal polar nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring drifting icebergs, and calving phenomena."

A76a is one of the largest icebergs in the world. After its calving in 2021, it continued its journey in the Antarctic Ocean. Oceanic currents have recently been carrying it closer to South Georgia, and it is now only approximately 600 km away from the island. The iceberg is roughly 130 km long and 27 km wide, making it slightly smaller than the island of Majorca."
"iceberg-d-28-weddell-sea"	"Iceberg D-28, known as Molar Berg, calved from the Amery Ice Shelf in September 2019. Since then, it has travelled more than 4000 km along the Antarctica coast and as shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image acquired on 17 February, is now just under 100 km from the Brunt Ice Shelf."
"icebergs-68a-68d-68e-and-68f"	"After calving from the Larsen-C Ice Shelf back in 2017, the A-68A iceberg has been drifting undisturbed in the Antarctic Ocean before reaching the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean at the end of April 2020. There, the iceberg started to split and an additional iceberg by the name of A-68C was formed. Following this split, iceberg A-68A continued to drift and, at the beginning of November, was spotted less than 450 kilometres off of the coast of one of the most wildlife-rich islands of the South Atlantic Ocean: South Georgia Island. After approaching the island up to a distance of 50 km and being temporarily stranded in shallow waters A-68A further disintegrated forming three new large bergs: A-68D, A-68E and A-68F. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites shows the status of Icebergs A-68A, A-68D, A-68E and A-68F on 23 December 2020. RADAR data obtained by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites, are not influenced by the presence of clouds, or by polar seasonal long nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring drifting icebergs. Image processed by Stef Lhermitte."
"icecap-melting-russian-arctic-islands"	"2020 was the hottest summer on record in the Northern Hemisphere. According to the Laboratory of Climatology and Topoclimatology of the Liege University, between June and August 2020, the ice caps of Franz Josef Land and the Russian High Arctic Islands have melted seven times more than in a “normal” summer, breaking all previous surface melt records. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 August, shows the status of the ice cap of Ushakov Island (Russian High Arctic Islands) at the end of the summer of 2020. The image allows to observe that the recent snow/ice cover (white area) persists only in the summit area of the island, while the oldest layers of the ice cap (blue areas) were exposed to the sunlight. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in the Arctic region."
"icecap-melting-russian-high-arctic-islands"	"The three months from May to July 2020 have been the warmest on record for the Northern Hemisphere. As a consequence of the high temperatures, Arctic sea ice extent is currently the 3rd lowest on record. Arctic ice caps have also been affected by the effects of high temperatures at high latitudes. As reported by the Laboratory of Climatology and Topoclimatology of the Liege University, the ice caps of Svalbard, Franz Joseph Land and Russian High Arctic Islands, have seen their extension diminish at record speed compared to previous years. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 August 2020, shows the ice cap of Komsomolets island (Russian High Arctic Islands). The extension of the ice cap as imaged by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites in September 2016 is also shown, for comparison purposes. The comparison allows to estimate the retreating of the ice cap to 120 m on average from 2016 to 2020. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in the Arctic region."
"icecap-melting-southern-greenland"	"The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible at high latitudes. According to a study published in Nature, Greenland lost 586 billion tons of ice in 2019, adding 1.5 millimetres to global sea-level rise. The summer of 2020 did not reach the exceptional levels of 2019 in Greenland, but, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), it was once again a season during which the melting of the ice sheet was higher than the reference value for the period 1981 - 2010. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 20 August 2020, shows the effects of the thaw in the area south of Nuuk, in southern Greenland: the grey-blue waters are coloured by the sediments carried in the surface runoff that pours into the Arctic Ocean. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in land surfaces in high detail even at northern latitudes and help monitor the glaciers melting."
"iceland-ice-cap"	"Iceland is home to 269 named glaciers, under various shapes and sizes of almost all types: ice caps, outlet glaciers, mountain glaciers, alpine, piedmont and cirque glaciers, ice streams, etc. Ice caps are the largest among these and are found in the central and southern Iceland. The largest ice cap in the country, Vatnajökull, covers an area of around 7,900 km2, about three times the size of Luxembourg.

"icelands-successful-shift-towards-sustainable-energy"	"Iceland is often called “the land of fire and ice”. It is this mixture of geology and northerly location that gives the country its extensive access to renewable energy. The island lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, a very active volcanic zone that powers its geothermal systems. Glaciers cover eleven per cent of the country’s surface. Seasonal melt feeds glacial rivers, which run from mountains towards the sea, contributing to Iceland’s hydropower resources. Geothermal heat, in particular, is significant in most parts of the country, and in many places, hot water from just below the surface is used to heat homes and for energy production. These conditions have allowed Iceland to successfully move away from fossil fuels and shift to achieving 100% electricity production from renewable sources. This image, acquired by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the southwestern side of Iceland, providing a wide view of the capital city Reykjavik, the Reykjanes Peninsula and zooming at the same time on the location of the Hellisheidi Power Plant, that is Iceland’s largest geothermal plant and the world’s third-largest. Copernicus, in addition to the provision of satellite images via Sentinel satellites, also includes provides services in six thematic areas: Land Monitoring, Emergency Management, Climate Change, Marine Monitoring, Atmosphere Monitoring and Security.

"impact-flash-floods-near-saint-martin-vesubie-france"	"On 3 October, heavy rains caused by Storm Alex caused flash floods in the Alpes-Maritimes (south-eastern France), destroying dozens of houses and washing away roads and bridges in the mountainous region near Nice. At least seven people have died and more than 20 people are still missing. On 8 October, a firefighter was found dead. His vehicle had been washed away after a road collapsed near the village of Saint-Martin-Vésubie, one of the villages most affected by the flash floods. In view of the extensive damages caused by the floods, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Rapid Mapping componentwas activated (EMSR467) by France’s Civil Protection to monitor the flooded areas with delineation maps derived from Very High Resolution satellite data. The two images presented here were acquired on 28 September 2020 (before the event) and on 8 October 2020 (after the event) by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. They show the impact of Storm Alex near Saint-Martin-Vésubie and along the Vésubie river. The images show that the width of the river bed of the Vésubie shot up from from just a few meters before the event to more than 180 meters during the flash floods. Unfortunately, many houses in the area have been washed away by the fury of the water. High resolution open data from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allow us to to develop an accurate understanding of the flood’s extent and contribute to damage assessment in the affected areas."
"impact-ongoing-drought-sau-reservoir-catalunya"	"The Sau Reservoir, also known as Pantà de Sau in Catalan, is a large reservoir located in the province of Barcelona, in the Spanish autonomous region of Catalunya. The reservoir was built in the 1960s by damming the Ter River and is a vital source of water and hydroelectric power for the region. As a result of the severe drought ongoing in Europe, the reservoir is currently at about 10% of its capacity, the lowest level in decades. Operations are ongoing to remove a significant quantity of fish from the reservoir in order to preserve the quality of its water and guarantee a source of drinking water for the region.

"intense-wildfire-season-mexico"	"These two images show, left, the concentration of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the tropospheric column over Mexico, as measured by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite on May 4, 2021, and on the right, a view, acquired by one of the two satellites of the Sentinel-2 mission on the same day, of one of the many wildfires that are affecting the country, located about 80 km east of the city of San Luis Potosi. According to the National Forest Commission of Mexico, the current fire season is one of the worst in the past 6 years, with data on the number of fires and burnt forest area that are only second to those recorded in 2017. The period from 1 January to 15 April 2021 has seen a 97% increase in the number of fires compared to the same period in 2020 and of 29% compared to 2019. Official data records a total number of fires above 4000 for the first quarter of 2021. One of the main causes of such an increase in the number of wildfires is the extreme drought conditions which are affecting about 85% of the country. According to the Mexican Meteorological Service, the situation is critical, especially in Northern Mexico. The Sentinel missions of the Copernicus Programme provide petabytes of free and open data and allow to monitor our planet by measuring a wide spectrum of highly relevant parameters from space: while the Sentinel-5P mission provides daily information on air quality and on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, the twin Sentinel-2 satellites are equipped with a high (up to 10m) spatial resolution multispectral instrument which allows to image areas affected by wildfires and to monitor their evolution over time. Finally, the twin Sentinel-3 satellites can perform fire detection and deliver information about aerosols."

"ionian-islands-greece"	"Natura 2000 is a network of core breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species, and some rare protected natural habitat types. It stretches across all 27 EU Member States, both on land and at sea. The aim of the network is to ensure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. It is made up of Special Areas of Conservation (SPC) and Special Protection Areas (SPA) designated under the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, the two EU directives that are related to wildlife and nature conservation. The approach to conservation and sustainable use of the Natura 2000 areas does not exclude human activities from the protected sites because it is centred on people working with nature rather than against it. This image captured by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 20 September 2020 shows the island of Lefkada, that is one of the seven major Ionian Islands and a group of smaller ionian islands. In this area, two different Natura2000 sites have been designated. One consists of the central and mountainous part of Lefkada and its importance is the consequence on the presence of some important floristic and biogeographical elements. The second site, known as Esoteriko Archipelagos Ioniou (Meganisi, Arkoudi, Atokos, Vromonas), protects the local marine environment including the coasts of smaller islands and islets that are almost all visible in the image. The geomorphology of these islands’ coasts creates various habitats for the marine and land flora and fauna. The pristine waters of the archipelago provide a shelter to important marine predator species on the top of the food chain, as a result the biological richness of the area. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, composed by two twin satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B), provides multispectral data in 13 different spectral bands with a maximum spatial resolution of 10 metres. The conservation and protection of biodiversity is a fundamental activity in protected areas, such as the Samaria National Park, in Greece.

"lagoon-seven-cities"	"According to an ancient legend, Lagoa Azul (Blue Lake) and Lagoa Verde (Green Lake) in the Portuguese archipelago of Azores, were formed when a blue-eyed princess and green-eyed shepherd were set apart. The tears both shed because of their misfortune formed two lakes with the colours of their eyes. The beautiful pallet displayed by the two lakes tells another story – a story of how the destruction of forested areas, their transformation into grassland and pasture increased the runoff of nutrients (in particular phosphorus and nitrogen). The lack of domestic sewage system (back in the mid-20th century) and the increased pressure on the ecosystem led to the eutrophication of the lakes as a result from nutrient enrichment fuelled by human agriculture and domestic activities. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 June 2017, shows the “Lagoon of the Seven Cities”, the twin lake located in the crater of a dormant volcano.

It supports a large population of plant and animal species. Owing to the lake’s many beaches and summer festivals and to its stunningly clear freshwater, the Lake Balaton area is a popular tourist destination in Hungary. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 July 2020, shows the magnificent turquoise waters of Lake Balaton. This colour is most likely due to the absence of floating sediments and algae as well as to the particular mix of chemical compounds in its waters. The lake is described as a sulphato-carbonate lake due to the high concentrations of carbonates and sulphates in its water. The frequent revisit time of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites over the same area and their high spatial resolution allow changes in inland water bodies to be closely monitored."
"lake-balkhash-kazakhstan"	"Lake Balkhash is one of the largest lakes in Asia and the 15th largest lake in the world. Even though the lake is in a desert, it is fed by several rivers and serves as a habitat for 20 species of fish, 120 species of birds, and 60 species of indigenous plants. Like the Aral Sea, Lake Balkhash is shrinking as a result of the water from the rivers feeding it being diverted for agricultural and industrial purposes before being able to reach the lake. Climate change has also been linked to a reduction in precipitation in the area. Taken together, these two processes are putting the lake habitat at serious risk. At the end of October 2020, Science magazine relayed an appeal to local authorities to take action in preserving this precious ecosystem and avoiding the same environmental disaster that has already befallen the Aral Sea. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellites on 20 September, shows the eastern part of Lake Balkhash. Every day the Copernicus Sentinel missions deliver petabytes of open data that are useful for monitoring the state of ecosystems around the world."
"lake-balkhash-spring-colours"	"Lake Balkhash, a Ramsar Convention site in Kazakhstan, is a crucial breeding ground for waterbirds and home to endemic fish species. The lake has been recognised as a site of global significance for biodiversity and plays a vital role in regulating the regional climate. On 4 April, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this image of its beautiful turquoise-brown waters, whose colours result from the winter ice melting. Copernicus supports the monitoring of this precious ecosystem, providing crucial data for its conservation and sustainable use."
"lake-coatepeque-turned-turquoise"	"Lake Coatepeque is a lake of volcanic origin located in the Los Volcanes National Park in El Salvador. In the past few weeks, the colour of its water changed from dark blue to turquoise. The director of the Coatepeque Foundation, which works to protect the area, attributes the phenomenon to the interaction between the fresh water that reached the lake as a result of recent rains and the volcanic material deposited on the bottom of the lake. The unusual phenomenon was captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 August. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, with their Multi-Spectral Instrument, deliver useful information about water colour and its impact on water quality."
"lake-fitri"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 20 October 2020 shows Lake Fitri, in Chad. Lake Fitri is a sink lake, a collection of water within an endorheic basin, that retains water and allows no outflow to other external bodies of water, such as rivers or oceans, but converges instead into lakes or swamps, permanent or seasonal, that equilibrate through evaporation It is located in the southern Sahara Desert and fed by seasonal rainfall: its area can triple in wet years but it may dry out completely in case of in wetter years. In 2005 it was designated under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance because its habitat hosts wintering of Palearctic waterbirds and is a drought refuge for Afrotropical species and elephants. Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a two-spacecraft satellite mission used to deliver data that improves knowledge about permanent and seasonal vegetation of wetlands."
"lake-garda-continues-be-threatened-drought"	"Northern Italy is facing worrying drought conditions. The Po River, Italy's longest river, reached its lowest level ever recorded in April, while water levels in Lake Garda, Italy's largest lake shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image of 16 April, plummeted to their lowest point since 1953. This drop puts water in Lake Garda only 45.8 cm above the hydrometric zero, compared to the 70-year average of 109 cm. As a crucial freshwater reservoir, the current capacity of Lake Garda puts at risk its ability to sustain agriculture, local communities, tourism and navigation. The Copernicus European Drought Observatory enables accurate monitoring of drought conditions, providing key data for informed decision-making and effective resource management."
"lake-garda-unaffected-ongoing-drought-northern-italy"	"Lake Garda, shown in this image acquired on 11 April 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, is the largest lake in Italy, with an area of 370 km2 and a full capacity of 49 km3. It is located between Brescia and Verona in the north of the country, where the low levels of precipitation and warmer than average temperatures have caused a severe drought that has been affecting the Po valley for months. Lake Garda, however, has not been significantly impacted by the consequences of the drought and is currently at 80,7% of its total capacity, thanks to the proper management of its water flow during the winter months. Conversely, other lakes in the region are showing the acute consequences of the drought: Lake Iseo and Lake Como are respectively at 10% and 6,5% of their total capacity. The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, which provide drought indicators and early warning for droughts in Europe (EDO) and worldwide (GDO)."
"lake-geneva-september-2021"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 September 2021, shows fantastic swirls decorating the waters of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. A recent study conducted on the waters of Lake Geneva, published in the scientific journal Nature, has shown how climate change may be impacting the ecosystems of the world's largest lakes. According to researchers, rising global temperatures could affect the levels of oxygen and other vital nutrients in natural ecosystems, inhibiting the optimal conditions for their sustainable development. Data from Copernicus missions are particularly useful for monitoring the water quality of water bodies."
"lake-inside-halemaumau-crater-kilauea-volcano-hawaii"	"On 25 July 2019, for the first time, reports indicated that water was accumulating inside the Halema'uma'u crater, on the summit of the Kīlauea volcano. In the past twelve months, the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) has monitored this body of water which grew from a nascent pond to an actual lake, the first observed in the Kīlauea caldera in at least 200 years. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 July 2020, shows in blue tones the lake that, at the time of the acquisition, reached an extension of3,3 ha. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides support to volcano monitoring services and, with its twin-satellite capability, ensures high-resolution, frequent and systematic coverage to allow the mapping of consequences of eruptions."
"lake-kerkini-greece"	"Lake Kerkini in Greece This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 January 2023, shows Lake Kerkini, one of the most important wetlands in Greece.

"lake-neusiedl"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 January 2023, shows Lake Neusiedl, a unique and beautiful water body located on the border of Austria and Hungary. As the largest endorheic lake (i.e., having no outflow to an external body of water such as a river or ocean) in Central Europe, it is home to a rich biodiversity. The lake supports a wide range of ecosystems, from wetlands and reed beds to grasslands and woodlands, providing vital habitats for many species of wildlife. From graceful swans and majestic herons to playful otters and mischievous foxes, Lake Neusiedl is an ecological treasure trove. The lake is also an important stopover point for many migrating birds, making it a popular destination for birdwatching."
"lake-powell-affected-drought-united-states"	"These images, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 17 April 2020 and 17 April 2021, provide evidence for the drought affecting Lake Powell in the United States, the second largest artificial lake in the country. Lake Powell was created along the course of the Colorado River with the purpose of supplying water to Nevada, Arizona and California and to generate hydroelectric power at the Hoover Dam. According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, this year’s spell of drought is the worst ever recorded in the Colorado River basin, and has caused the water level of Lake Powell to drop dramatically. In a recent report, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation predicts that the coming months will see the water level of Lake Powell drop so low as to threaten the supply of the Colorado River, which serves as a water source to a number of cities (e.g. Las Vegas) and agricultural areas. This situation may trigger the U.S. federal government to issue its first ever official water shortage declaration and prompt restrictions in Arizona and Nevada. With an average revisit time of five days at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor droughts and their impact on crucial ecosystems."
"lake-pyramid-algal-bloom"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 September 2021, shows a massive algal bloom ongoing in Nevada’s Lake Pyramid. Lake Pyramid is affected by algal blooms every year. The phenomenon is mainly associated with cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, which, in large concentrations, can be harmful to human health. The 2021 bloom is so massive that the authorities urged the population to avoid contact with the lake water. Data from Copernicus missions are particularly well suited to detecting and monitoring Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) worldwide."
"lake-st-clair-usa-and-canada"	"This image, acquired by a Sentinel-2 satellite on 11 October 2020, shows Lake St. Clair which is located on the border between Ontario in Canada (east of the image) and Michigan in the USA (west of the image). The lake is fed by the homonymous Saint Clair river, which divides into numerous channels before reaching the lake, thus creating a seven branches delta. Much of the territory surrounding the delta is used for agricultural purposes. The water colour, which in this image varies from cyan to deep blue, is due to the presence of algal blooms along the northern part of the Michigan coast and along the Ontario coast, as well as the limited circulation of its shallow waters (the lake is on average 3 meters deep). The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission enables very accurate monitoring of inland waters."
"lake-uru-uru-threatened-pollution-and-climate-change-bolivia"	"This image, acquired by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 April 2021, shows Lake Uru Uru in Bolivia. Prior to 2021, Lake Uru Uru had been known for its thriving ecosystem protected by the RAMSAR intergovernmental convention on wetlands, which had also made it into a tourist attraction for boating and fishing. However, due to the effects of pollution and a prolonged drought induced by climate change, the lake has become polluted and covered by trash and industrial waste. On 7 April 2021, the day before this image was acquired, hundreds of volunteers gathered at Lake Uru Uru to start collecting plastic waste and cleaning up litter, in hopes to restore it to its former condition. Amongst other diverse purposes, open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission are used as inputs for pioneering projects aimed at detecting and monitoring marine debris such as floating plastic litter."
"lake-velence-hungary-threatened-climate-change"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 August 2021, shows Lake Velence in Hungary. Lake Velence is a freshwater lake rich in biodiversity, home to several priority species listed in the EU Nature Directives. It is also a Ramsar and a Natura 2000 site. Climate change is seriously threatening it and it is now facing an unprecedented ecological crisis. Multiple heatwaves and prolonged drought have caused the lake to lose nearly half of its water in the past two years. Several protected species are abandoning their habitats due to the new climatic conditions, causing dramatic ecosystem degradation. The data provided by Copernicus satellites and services make it possible to extract vital information on the state of implementation of European policies, including those related to the monitoring of water quality and the protection of critical biodiversity sites."
"land-surface-temperature-france"	"A strong and long-lasting heatwave is currently affecting western and central Europe. Temperatures started rising on 6 August, reaching peak values in the UK and France on 8 and 9 August 2020. In particular, temperatures in France broke new records for the month of August in Creil (39.3°C) and Rouen (38.4°C). This image shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST) map over central France as sensed by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 9 August 2020. This LST is the temperature of the soil and should not be confused with the air temperature. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellite(Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are both equipped with the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer SLSTR, an instrument with a main objective of providing global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) with a very high level of accuracy (for both climatological and meteorological applications). Land surface temperature maps are also used for commercial agricultural purposes to evaluate water and irrigation requirements during summer periods when crops may be exposed to heat stress or, in contrast, during winter periods, when crops and trees may be exposed to damaging frost."
"land-surface-temperature-over-southwest-united-states"	"This image shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST) over the Southwest United States, as measured by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 18 June 2021 (NB: the LST is the temperature of the soil and should not be confused with the air temperature at ground level). An “apocalyptic” heatwave has been affecting the area since the beginning of the week. The National Weather Service has issued excessive heat warnings for five states - California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and parts of Colorado - warning that record temperatures well above 38 degrees Celsius could be reached. One-eighth of the US population -- over 40 million people -- is on alert across the western US for a potentially long-lasting, lethal heatwave. Red flag warnings have also been issued across the Southwest to warn of fire dangers. Major blazes are burning across the region, in particular in Arizona, where the Telegraph and Mescal fires have merged resulting in a combined burnt area of 100,000 ha or 1,000 km2, turning the incident into one of the largest wildfires in the State’s history. Power grids have also been put under strain as Texas and California urged consumers to conserve energy during peak times to avoid blackouts. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) both equipped with the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, an instrument whose main objective is to provide Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) with a very high level of accuracy, for both climatological and meteorological applications."
"land-surface-temperature-sakha-republic"	"This image, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites on 20 June 2021, shows the Land Surface Temperature in the Sakha Republic in Arctic Siberia. Siberia, and in particular the Republic of Sakha, is experiencing a persistent heatwave. As the image shows, the land surface temperature has widely exceeded 35°C across Siberia, with peaks of 48°C near Verkhojansk, 43°C in Govorovo and 37°C in Saskylah. In Saskylah, on the day this image was acquired, a temperature of 31.9°C was recorded, the highest value since 1936 before the summer solstice. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission consists of twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, able of measuring thermal parameters of both terrestrial and marine environments. This specificity allows to derive parameters such as land surface temperatures over periods of time and compare them from year to year. Warning: this data shows Land Surface Temperature not air temperature at ground level"
"land-surface-temperature-siberia"	"Siberia is experiencing its second heatwave of 2020. Many historical temperature records have been broken, including in Verchojansk (according to unverified reports) – a town in the east of Siberia known for its exceptionally cold winters – which broke its all-time temperature record hitting 38.0°C on 19 June 2020 against a previous record of 37.3°C on 25/07/1988. This image shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST) obtained from Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite data acquired on 19 June 2020. LST can be thought of as showing “skin surface temperatures of the Earth” and in this acquisition, data shows large areas of Siberia’s LST (within the Arctic Circle) exceeding 40°C. These significative LST values are due to the combination of the heatwave and the scarce cloud coverage over the area. Warning: this data shows Land Surface Temperature not air temperature at ground level. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B that can measure thermal parameters for both land and marine environments. This allows us to derive parameters such as Land Surface Temperatures over periods of time and compare from year to year. Scientists study the influence of this parameter on glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, the vegetation in Earth's ecosystems, and can even study how the increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases affect land surface temperature."
"land-surface-temperature-western-usa-and-northern-mexico"	"Between 14 and 16 August 2020, parts the Arizona, Nevada and California states in USA and areas of the Baja California and Sonora states in Mexico experienced a severe heatwave. In Death Valley National Park (California) an air temperature of 54.4 ° C was recorded on 16 August 2020, the second highest temperature reached since 1913 (pending validation of the measurement by the World Meteorological Organisation). This image, obtained from data retrieved by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 16 August, shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST – not to be confused with the air temperature) over the western USA and north Mexico. LST reached values above 60°C (areas in dark red / black tones). In Death Valley (California – USA) LST was recorded at 69.1°C at 18:26:05 UTC, 11:26 am local time, when the data was acquired.

"landslide-alta-norway"	"A destructive landslide of 3 hectares swept eight buildings into the sea on 3 June. The landslide occurred in the Alta Municipality, a municipality at the northern tip of Norway. There were no injuries or fatalities, even though there were two people in the cabins at the time of the landslide who managed to escape. The cause of the slide is not yet known, but it could be related to the saturation of the soil caused by the melting snow and heavy rainfall in the area. This mosaic, obtained with images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 27 May and 13 June, shows the area affected by the landslide before (top left) and after the event (top right), and a multitemporal image (right) with the areas affected by the slide appearing in red obtained by combining the before and after data. Data derived by Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites are suitable for mapping and monitoring landslides."
"lanzarote-island-spain"	"Desertification is a biogeochemical process of land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, itis caused primarily by human activities and variations in climate. Desertification does not refer to the expansion of existing deserts: it occurs because dryland ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation and inappropriate land use. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellites on 12 February 2020, shows the Spanish island of Lanzarote, one of Europe’s most threatened areas to desertification, according to a study of the University of Alicante. The sensors onboard the Copernicus Sentinel Satellites missions play an important role in monitoring and assessing drylands. And are particularly suitable for assessing the progress of desertification in vulnerable ecosystems."
"laohugou-no-12-glacier-tibetan-plateau-china"	"This 3D rendering obtained from imagery acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 November 2020, shows the Laohugou No. 12 glacier in the Qilian Mountains (Tibetan plateau - China). Glaciers in the Qilian Mountains are important sources of fresh-water in arid northwest China, but in the last few decades, these glaciers have shrunk due to climate changes. According to researchers from the Qilian Shan Station of Glaciology and Ecologic Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Laohugou No. 12 glacier retreated 50% faster in 1990-2010 than in reference period 1956 to 1990. In particular, the glacier has retreated about 450 meters and has lost about 13 meters in thickness since the monitoring activities started. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in the environment around glaciers in high detail and to monitor their retreat."
"large-phytoplankton-bloom-barents-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 3 August 2023, shows a large phytoplankton bloom north of the Scandinavian Peninsula, spanning over 200,000 km². Phytoplankton consists of microscopic plant-like organisms that float in seas and oceans, which play a vital role in the marine ecosystem. In the Barents Sea, an Arctic region subject to a delicate equilibrium between temperature and salinity, these blooms are a relatively common phenomenon, particularly during the summer months when the abundance of sunlight stimulates phytoplankton growth. Observation of these phenomena is crucial for understanding changes in marine ecosystems and potential repercussions on fish resources and global climate. Copernicus open data allow for monitoring and analysing these phenomena in near real-time."
"large-scale-mosaic-part-europe"	"This image has been obtained using thousands of images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar satellites between 18 April 2020 and 17 April 2021 (in descending orbit). It represents a mosaic of part of Europe and allows to observe the seasonal vegetation changes during the reference period. The image shows the areas where vegetation was present only during the spring 2020 in red, in green the areas where vegetation was present only during the summer of 2020, in yellow those where vegetation was present during both the spring, autumn 2020 and winter 2021. All other areas had some vegetation cover throughout the period of reference. Large-scale mosaics of satellite data are crucial for several applications including mapping of large natural hazard areas, land cover classification and land management.

"low-ice-coverage-extent-great-lakes-north-america"	"Despite the cold weather, the ice coverage of the Great Lakes remains significantly below its average winter extent. Ice is covering only 13.91% of the surface of Lake Michigan, about 8% below the winter’s average, This is one of the lowest ice extents on record, second only to the 12.4% of ice coverage measured in 2002. Even though the cold temperatures could cause further ice formation, coverage is still likely to remain lower than the winter historical average. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 February 2023, shows the ice present in Lake Michigan offshore from the town of Racine in Wisconsin, USA. The Snow and Ice Monitoring product provided by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) provides data on various parameters that are key to the monitoring of snow and ice, including aggregated lake ice extent."
"low-snow-cover-mount-ruapheu-new-zealand"	"The austral winter season has just ended in New Zealand. According to the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), it was the warmest winter on record, with temperatures more than 1.2°C above average in several regions. Moreover, the season was especially wet and most of the country experienced higher-than-average rainfall. These climatic conditions have affected some of New Zealand’s landscapes and tourism infrastructure, such as the ski resorts located on Mount Ruapheu, which have been forced to close earlier than usual because of the extremely limited snow cover in the area. The lack of snow on Mount Ruapheu is visible when comparing these two images, acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 October 2021 and 7 October 2022. Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide free and open data that is used to monitor snow cover, an important driver of many climatic, environmental and economic processes worldwide."
"low-water-levels-impacting-traffic-rhine-river"	"These images, acquired by Copernicus-2 Sentinel satellites on 28 June 2022 and 8 July 2023, show the impact of drought on the Rhine river in the area of Koblenz, Germany. This waterway plays an important role in Europe's inland transport, handling approximately 75 percent of all goods transported by this method. Currently, the water level in Kaub, a town located 30 km southeastern of Koblenz, is just over one metre, which is considered critical. If the water level drops below 30 centimetres, it becomes impossible for large vessels to navigate through the Kaub bottleneck. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor droughts and their impact on ecosystems and infrastructure."

"mackenzie-river-delta"	"The Mackenzie river is the second longest river in North America, and its tributaries, the smaller rivers that connect to it, run through a fifth of Canada. The river originates in Great Slave Lake and flows 1,738 kilometres into the Mackenzie Delta and the Arctic Ocean. About 7 per cent of the freshwater flowing into the Arctic Ocean each year stems from the Mackenzie and its delta: The water flow reaches its maximum in spring and summer as the waters carry sediments and nutrients into the seas, and ends with the formation of sea ice towards autumn and winter in the Arctic Ocean. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 17 October 2020, shows a rare cloud-free image of the Mackenzie River Delta at the beginning of the winter refreezing process. Highly detailed data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in land surfaces at northern latitudes."
"madagascar-affected-worst-drought-40-years"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 August 2021, shows the Ampanihy district in southern Madagascar. According to the United Nation’s World Food Programme, southern Madagascar is going through the highest internationally recognised level of food insecurity as a consequence of the worst drought in 40 years. This condition, which experts consider to be a manifestation of climate change, caused severe damages to agricultural production during the main harvest period of May-June 2021, with losses of up to 60 percent in the Grand Sud region. The most affected area is the Ampanihy district, the area depicted in the image. With a revisit time of five days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor droughts and their impact on ecosystems."

"makgadikgadi-pans-botswana"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 March 2021, shows the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana. The Makgadikgadi Pans are one of the largest salt pans in the world. For much of the year, the salt pans glow white, dried by the sun and the absence of rain. After the rainy season (approximately from November to March), the area turns into a lush wetland that is home to zebras, ducks, flamingos, turtles etc. Two thousand years ago, the Makgadikgadi Pans were one of the largest inland seas on Earth, rich in flora and fauna. According to a study published in the journal Nature, Homo Sapiens originated in the region around the Makgadikgadi Pans, and from there, they began their migration after climate change profoundly altered the climate of the area. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change on fragile ecosystems around the world."
"malaspina-glacier-alaska-usa"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 September 2021, shows the Malaspina Glacier in Alaska, USA. Malaspina is the largest piedmont glacier in the world. It flows faster than the piedmont glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland and is therefore widely studied by scientists around the world. In particular, its cycles of surges and retreats and its vulnerability to climate change have recently been studied using Copernicus and Landsat data. Among the most interesting results, it was found that in the event of a sea level rise induced by global warming, seawater could cause major changes in the glacier's terminus and lead to severe impacts on habitats in the area."
"malta-gozo-island"	"This Copernicus Sentinel-2 image acquired on 2 January 2022 shows Gozo, one of the islands of the Maltese archipelago. The area is famous for its rural hiking trails, its beaches and scuba diving sites, and for the remains of the Neolithic temples of Ġgantija, amongst the world's oldest free-standing structures, which are even older than the Pyramids of Gizeh in Egypt."
"manicouagan-lake-canada"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 November 2020, shows a rare cloud free view of the Manicouagan Lake in Canada. The Manicouagan Lake, also known as “the eye of Quebec”, located in the centre of the Province, is an annular lake, formed about 214 million years ago after the impact of a meteorite. The impact melted the rock and pressure created the central mound and also likely caused an environmental disaster. At the centre of the lake, there is the René-Levasseur island, the second largest lake island in the world. Since 2007, the area is a biosphere reserve protected by the UNESCO. The high spatial resolution and the high revisit frequency of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allow for accurate land monitoring and mapping."
"mar-menor-risk-oxygen-depletion"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 April 2022, shows the Mar Menor, in Spain. It is a large lagoon on the southeast coast of the country, separated from the Mediterranean Sea by a strip of land 22 kilometres long. According to a report published by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) for the Ministry for the Ecological Transition, its waters are at risk of oxygen depletion, which could threaten its marine ecosystems. The scientists point out that, in recent decades, the lagoon’s environment has been suffering from a massive influx of nutrients from human activity, as a consequence of intensive agriculture and mass tourism in the area. Secondly, the report warns that the heavy rainfall that has affected the area in March has caused a drop in salinity of the Mar Menor’s waters, a crucial variable for its environment. The Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) provides free and open data and services that enable the monitoring of marine ecosystems and support policy implementation."
"mar-menor-spain"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 September 2021, shows the Mar Menor in Spain. The Mar Menor is the largest saltwater wetland in Europe. Although the area is a Ramsar site (designated as being of “international importance” by the 1971 Convention on Wetlands), and protected by several EU directives, its waters are heavily polluted due to unsustainable agricultural practices in the surrounding lowlands. Recently, the Spanish government announced the funding of several projects to enable the environmental regeneration of the area, with the aim of conserving biodiversity in and around the lagoon, including the creation of a 1.5 kilometre buffer zone along the shores of the Mar Menor. Copernicus, with its open-source data, allows for wide-ranging monitoring of the water quality of wetlands around the world."
"marine-protected-areas-can-mitigate-effects-climate-change"	"Marine protected areas are an important tool to combat the effects of climate change. In fact, according to study recently published by the CNRS, the French National Centre for Scientific Research, marine protected areas can significantly improve coastal protection and the preservation of the biodiversity of marine organisms, as well as contribute to carbon sequestration, a process that stores carbon dioxide (or other forms of carbon) thus mitigating the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The study was conducted in Portofino, in north-western Italy, shown in this image, which was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 October 2022. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and services make it possible to extract key information on the state of implementation of European policies, including those related to the protection of marine areas."
"mass-greenland-ice-sheet-increased-january-2022"	"Following a period of above-average temperatures, heavy snowfall occurred in Greenland on 20 January. According to the researchers of the Climatological Laboratory of the University of Liège, the large amount of snow deposited caused a significant increase in the mass of the island's ice sheet. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 21 January, shows a thick blanket of snow covering the municipality of Qaqortoq, in southern Greenland. The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service product portfolio includes High-Resolution Snow and Ice Monitoring (HR-S&I) products, providing in near real-time high-resolution (20m × 20m) snow and ice data for the 39 Member States of the European Environment Agency."
"massive-algal-blooms-gulf-finland"	"Every summer, colourful algal blooms can be observed in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. As this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 August 2022 shows, a massive algal bloom was ongoing in the central-eastern part of the Baltic Sea, known as the Gulf of Finland. This bloom was probably triggered by heat waves in the area in June and July 2022. According to Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service data, the current sea surface temperature anomaly in the area is of approximately +2ºC. The resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allows Copernicus services to monitor marine biological activity and water quality worldwide."

"massive-gobi-desert-dust-storm-sweeps-across-east-asia"	"At the beginning of April, a massive dust storm originating in the Gobi desert swept across several countries in East Asia, including China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan. The dust storms led to reduced visibility and respiratory issues among the population. On 13 April, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured the extent of the dust that had reached the northern part of Japan, after traveling for more than 3,000 km. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides real-time information and forecasts on the dust storms to support public health and safety measures."
"massive-melting-ice-cap-greenland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 21 August 2021, shows meltwaters flowing above the ice cap near Kangerlussuaq in southwest Greenland. A massive melting of the ice sheet occurred in conjunction with a heatwave, during which rain was observed for the first time at the Summit Camp Station, the highest point of the ice cap. According to climatologists of the University of Liège, the ice sheet has reached the highest maximum daily melting rate recorded since 1950 as a consequence of the high temperatures. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission plays an important role in Arctic research applications because it allows the recovery of spectral albedo and the derivation of several properties of ice and snow."
"massive-melting-ice-cap-iceland"	"These three images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16, 24 and 28 August provide evidence of the massive melting of Iceland's ice sheets following the heatwave that has recently affected the island. The images show the Þrándarjökull glacier, which is located a few kilometres from Hallormsstaður, the town where a record temperature of 29.4°C was registered on 24 August. The satellite images, acquired before, during and after the heatwave, show a shift from a situation of partial snow cover on the top of the ice sheet (on 16 August) to complete exposure of the older ice layers (on 28 August). According to the Climate Laboratory of the University of Liège, this massive melting episode of the Icelandic ice caps was the worst recorded in recent years. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission plays an important role in research applications as it allows the retrieval of spectral albedo data and the monitoring of several properties of ice and snow."
"massive-phytoplankton-bloom-barents-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 2 August 2021, shows a massive phytoplankton bloom in the Barents Sea. At the peak of summer, phytoplankton blooms in the Barents Sea can extend for hundreds of kilometres. Their growth is favoured by the water stratification that occurs at this time of year. The stratification of the waters occurs not only due to the high insolation but also because the Barents Sea is involved in the cooling process of the Arctic Ocean through the dissipation of heat from its surface waters. According to a recent study published in the Nature scientific journal, the Barents Sea, in the future, will not be able to dissipate the heat carried towards the Arctic by the Gulf Stream as a consequence of climate change. It will result in a greater contribution of the Arctic Ocean, and consequently, the process of Atlantification of the area will be increased. Data from Copernicus services and satellite missions provide innovative data for the study of climate change."

"massive-saharan-dust-storm-affecting-western-europe"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 15 March 2022, shows the Saharan dust cloud engulfing the skies over France, Spain and Portugal. The dust was brought to Europe by storm Celia, which has caused a warm air mass from North Africa to reach Europe. The passage of the air mass through the Sahara Desert explains the visible presence of dust in the air. Spain was especially affected by the dust cloud: the storm, which reached its peak between 15 March and 16 March 2022, has been described by the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) as “extraordinary” for its intensity and extent. The suspended dust has heavily impacted air quality in several areas, to the point that the residents in affected communities have been advised by the local authorities to avoid staying outside for long periods of time .It has also impacted visibility in most of the country, affecting air travel, causing the cancellation of seven flights from the Canary Islands. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecasts have been showing the large plume of dust approaching western Europe since 11 March and continue monitoring dust concentration and air quality, using satellite and in situ observations to provide continuous and reliable information."
"massive-sargassum-bloom-atlantic-ocean"	"This image, acquired on 14 March by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, captures banks of sargassum floating off the coast of the French island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. Sargassum is a brown seaweed commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean. However, the largest bloom in years began in early 2023 and has affected many coastlines in the region, causing damage to the tourism industry. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 data and Marine Service information on chlorophyll and currents enable the development of near-real-time monitoring and drift forecasts of sargassum in the Equatorial Atlantic region."
"massive-soil-erosion-affecting-bangladesh"	"In 2022, Bangladesh saw the worst floods in 20 nearly years. Floods caused severe bank erosion along the Padma and Meghna rivers. According to recent estimates by local authorities, more than 1,800 hectares of river banks were affected by soil erosion, and more than 10,000 houses were destroyed. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 October, shows one of the worst affected areas south of the capital Dhaka.

Data from Copernicus satellites allow the monitoring of snow cover around the world in high definition."
"maximum-arctic-sea-ice-extent-march-2023"	"Each year, Arctic sea ice reaches its maximum extent during the month of March. According to Copernicus Climate Change Service data, the 2023 maximum was reached in early March, with a total extent of 14.5 million km2. This is 4% below the 1991-2020 average for the month and the fourth lowest in the satellite era. The Labrador Sea in Canada, visible in this Sentinel-3 image captured on 11 April, recorded one of the lowest concentrations of sea ice. While the Barents Sea and the Svalbard region had below-average sea ice concentrations, the Greenland Sea saw much above-average concentrations due to the atmospheric circulation patterns observed in March. More details are available here."

Data derived from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are used to produce maps for authorities involved in emergency situations."
"mayotte-island-faces-severe-drought"	"This image, acquired by one of Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the Mayotte archipelago. The main island is suffering from an ongoing water scarcity problem which stems primarily from an extended period of drought that has severely depleted the island’s freshwater reserves. The region's reliance on rainwater and limited alternative sources has increased its vulnerability to water shortages. Rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns have further intensified the situation. With its Global Drought Observatory, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service supports drought monitoring worldwide."
"mean-sea-level-rising-dublin-bay"	"This image, acquired on 20 April 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the city of Dublin and the eponym bay, at the mouth of the Liffey River on the Irish Sea Coast. Due to its location, the city is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, namely, the rise of the Mean Sea Level (MSL). According to a study recently published by the European Geosciences Union (EGU) Journal, the Mean Sea Level in the Dublin Bay is rising faster than the global rate. The analysis, which covers eight decades of data on MSL in the Dublin Port, has in fact shown that the trends in recent years are above what climate change models had previously predicted. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides authoritative and accurate information about the past, present and future climate conditions, including specific Climate Indicators such as the Mean Sea Level, which can be found in the recently published European State of the Climate 2021. This authoritative Copernicus data helps researchers understand regional and global sea level trends and supports the development of effective climate action plans."
"mediterranean-cyclone-apollo"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 28 October 2021 at 09:05UTC, shows Mediterranean cyclone Apollo in the Ionian Sea. On the day this image was acquired, Apollo was forming to the south of Sicily, with winds of over 100km/h blowing around its centre. Forecasts predict that Apollo will bring torrential rains to eastern Sicily. This has caused the Italian Civil Protection to issue a red alert, the highest possible level. The area was already being monitored by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) because of the floods which had taken place in previous days, sadly causing 3 casualties. Because of the persistence of the emergency, CEMS will continue to monitor the situation as long as required."
"mekong-delta-vietnam"	"This image has been obtained using images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar satellites between 1 August 2020 and 1 May 2021 (in descending orbits). It allows us to visualise seasonal changes in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. The Mekong Delta is an area particularly vulnerable to climate change. As a consequence of sea-level rise, the salinity of the water that feeds the area's rice paddies has increased significantly in recent years. The changes in environmental conditions have been so significant that local farmers have been forced to convert their rice fields into shrimp farms. Rising salinity and rising sea levels could have disastrous consequences for the Delta. According to Le Anh Tuan, professor at Can Tho University's College of Environment and Natural Resources, a sea level rise of 0.7 to 1.0 metres would flood up to 40% of the entire region. The data obtained from the RADAR sensor on board the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites allow for the monitoring of naturally or accidentally flooded areas, including rice paddies, when data from optical satellites are not available due to cloud cover or night time."
"melting-accelerates-denman-glacier"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 12 November 2022, shows the Denman Glacier in West Antarctica. According to a new study published by the Geophysical Research Letters journal, the melting of the Denman Glacier has significantly accelerated in recent decades. Ocean heat flowing into the ice shelf cavity is likely to be one of the factors that make this glacier susceptible to unstable retreat. It is currently estimated that the amount of warm water entering the cavity could be enough to melt 64.2 billion tonnes of ice each year, causing the sea level to rise faster than previously expected. According to the study, if the glacier was to melt completely, sea level would rise by about 1.5 metres. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to monitor the retreat of glaciers globally."
"melting-african-glaciers-2040"	"This image, acquired on 26 August 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the Mount Kilimanjaro glaciers in Tanzania. According to the World Meteorological Organisation’s “The State of the Climate in Africa 2020” report, Africa's few glaciers will disappear in the coming decades due to climate change. In particular, the report indicates that the Mount Kilimanjaro (shown in this Sentinel-2 image), Mount Kenya and the Rwenzori Mountains glaciers have melted more quickly than the global average during recent years and that, if current trends continue, there will be a complete loss of ice by 2040. Copernicus includes several tools in its data and products portfolio which allow monitoring of the effects of climate change on our planet. The Copernicus Climate Change Service, for example, includes a simulator that allows us to find out the current level of global warming and compare it with the targets set by the 2015 Paris Climate Accords."

The Copernicus Marine Service has developed educational content to help citizens and stakeholders better understand marine plastic pollution and the threat it poses to the oceans."
"middelburg-blanketed-snow-netherlands"	"In the aftermath of Storm Darcy that hit Europe in the second week of February 2021, regions that rarely experience heavy snowfall have been blanketed in snow. The storm, which originated in Russia, has affected Northern European countries the most, causing major disruptions in daily life. The Netherlands has experienced its first large snowstorm in the past ten years, with disrupted air and rail traffic, and disruptions due to the snow were also recorded throughout the entire rail and road traffic network in Germany. In Brussels, the three largest train stations are temporarily being kept open for 24 hours a day to shelter the homeless from the snow and freezing temperatures. Storm Darcy is the latest extreme weather phenomenon in a particularly cold winter in Northern Europe. According to a report published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service on 9 February, the entire month of January 2021 was colder than average. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 February 2021, shows Middelburg covered with snow. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides high-resolution data are that can be used to produce detailed snow and ice map of Europe."
"mont-blanc-range-western-alps"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 August, shows the latest cloud-free image of the Mont Blanc range in the western Alps. Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the Alps and in Western Europe. According to a measurement from mid-September 2021 performed by surveyors from France’s Haute-Savoie Departmental Chamber, which is responsible for the periodical measurement of the height of Mont Blanc, the peak measures 4,807.81 metres; 92 centimetres less than in 2017. They also suggested that this result could be attributed partly to global climate change and partly to the processes of snow transport by wind at the summit. The measurement of the summit of Mont Blanc required very accurate and complex measurements (in the order of a tenth of a millimetre). If such a minute scale of detail were not required, it would be possible to derive a terrain elevation model from Copernicus Sentinel-1 data."
"more-major-floods-new-south-wales-australia"	"Severe floods continue to plague New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. The west of the state’s central area is affected by the worst flooding in 70 years. The magnitude of the floods is so important that the Ministry of Agriculture has indicated that they will affect commodity prices on the Australian continent. One of the towns that has suffered the worst damage is Forbes, shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 November 2022. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellite allow us to monitor the development of disasters worldwide and to estimate the extent of the affected areas."
"more-wildfires-sakha-republic"	"In 2020, the exceptional Siberian fire season shows no signs of ending. It has been record-breaking in terms of intensity but also because of its duration. Despite the arrival of the first snow, starting from the second week of September, numerous fires have occurred in Sakha Republic severely impacting local air quality. The containment activities involved 450 people and 99 equipment . This visualisation, derived from the data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellites on 19 September 2020, shows the smoke cloud from the wildfires ongoing in Sakha Republic together with a zoom on one of them. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor wildfires and their impact on land, vegetation and air quality."
"morteratsch-glacier-receding-record-rate"	"The repeated and intense heatwaves affecting Europe in the past months have caused an early melting of the snowpack in the Alps, leaving glaciers exposed to the sun. As a result, this year’s ice loss has been exceptionally high. The Morteratsch glacier, visible in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 July 2022, is currently receding at an alarming rate of about 5 centimetres per day. The situation is similar in other parts of the Alps, an environment especially vulnerable to the consequences of climate change due to their relatively low ice cover. Data from Copernicus satellites are key to mapping glaciers around the world, and to monitor the consequences that climate change has on these vulnerable environments."
"mose-operation-venice-lagoon"	"Severe weather hit Italy in the first weekend of December 2020. The border between Austria and Italy has been closed. Widespread flooding has been recorded in Sicily, Campania and Abruzzo. In Emilia Romagna, the Panaro river is overflowing and the Italian Civil Protection has requested the activation of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service to produce delimitation maps of the flooded areas. In Veneto, four hundred and eleven interventions were carried out in a few hours, while in Venice, for the first time since it was completed, the MOSE system, the mobile dyke system built to protect Venice and its lagoon from high tides, went into operations. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 5 December 2020 at 16:59 UTC, is the first satellite image ever acquired showing the MOSE in operation at the Bocca di Porto di Chioggia and the Bocca di Porto di Lido. RADAR data obtained by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites are not affected by the presence of clouds. They are therefore particularly useful for accurate monitoring of land and maritime structures with a frequency of one data every 6 days on average at the Equator."
"mount-erebus-antarctica"	"Mount Erebus is the second highest and most active volcano of Antarctica. It is also the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Its summit temperature averages between -20°C during the summer and -50°C in winter, for this reason, despite the volcanic activity, it remains covered by glaciers. At the centre of the volcano’s summit, there is a deep crater which contains two lava lakes famous for their active strombolian activity. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows a rare cloud-free view of the summit of Mount Erebus in which the lava lakes are clearly visible. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) plays an important role in monitoring volcanic activity thanks to the Short Wave InfraRed channels that are included amongst the 13 spectral bands of the Multispectral Instrument onboard these two satellites. The high spatial resolution and the high average revisit time (5 days at the equator) allow to monitor different volcanic processes and improve hot-spot detection techniques."
"mount-erebus-september-2021"	"This image, acquired on 29 September 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows Mount Erebus on Ross Island in Antarctica. Erebus is the southernmost active volcano in the world and is famous for its lake of boiling lava. Due to the extreme environmental conditions on Ross Island, the volcano is monitored primarily by satellite. According to the Global Volcanism Program, the level of thermal activity during 2020 was lower than in recent years. In this cloudless image, we can see the absence of visible volcanic activity within the crater. Data from the Copernicus satellites allow volcanoes to be monitored even in environments normally prohibitive for humans."
"mount-everest-himalayas"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 November, shows Mt. Everest in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas Mountains. Mount Everest, with its 8848 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l), is the highest mountain on the Earth. It has always been tought of as a remote and pristine site, but according to a new study from researchers at the University of Plymouth, microplastics were found in Everest’ snow and stream water samples, up to 8,440 m.a.s.l. Researchers explain that the major source of pollution are polyester, acrylic, nylon, and polypropylene (i.e. materials used by the climbers during the climbing) and suggest to focus on the development of new environmental solutions to avoid further development of this source of pollution which is so significant, that it has earned Mt. Everest the title of “the world's highest junkyard”. Snow cover and glaciers are an important driver of many ecological, climatic and hydrological processes in the Himalayas Region: both snow and glaciers can be monitored and mapped using the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites."
"movement-iceberg-b-22a"	"Iceberg B-22a was formed in 2001, when it calved from the ice shelf formed by the Thwaites glacier in West Antarctica and started floating in the Amundsen Sea. In 2022 and 2023, it started moving towards the northwest and drifted by about 112 kilometres, 21 of which were covered between December 2022 and January 2023. This image was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 18 January 2023. Previously acquired Copernicus Sentinel-3 images were used to trace and track Iceberg B-22a: its perimeter and position have been projected from past Copernicus Sentinel-3 acquisitions onto the latest image, to visualise the movement of the iceberg. The location of the iceberg on 11 October 2016 is indicated red, in blue its location on 25 December 2022, and finally in green its location on 18 January 2022. Copernicus open data are key for tracking the movement of icebergs floating in the ocean and the monitoring of remote environments such as Antarctica."
"mt-vesuvius-emerging-low-level-clouds"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the summit of the Vesuvius volcano in southern Italy, emerging from a layer of low-level clouds that are lying over the western Mediterranean Sea basin. The clouds have covered marine and coastal areas while leaving inland and mountainous areas uncovered. This rare phenomenon is associated with the anticyclonic weather pattern which has affected Europe over the last few days. The high pressure has also been accompanied by a heatwave that has brought record temperatures in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. Data from Copernicus satellites provide innovative data to improve the long-term monitoring of climate variables."
"muddus-national-park-sweden"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 May 2023, shows the Muddus National Park in Sweden. Spanning over 500 square kilometres, this park represents a unique and well-preserved example of boreal forest ecosystems. Its landscapes showcase the key characteristics of boreal forests, such as the dominance of coniferous tree species such as spruce and pine, which have adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Boreal forests safeguard biodiversity, uphold ecosystem functions, and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. Copernicus plays a vital role in the global conservation of forests. For example, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide valuable data which enables scientists and conservationists to monitor forest health, detect deforestation, and assess the impact of climate change. Such information is crucial for informed decision-making and effective forest preservation worldwide."
"mulajokull-glacial-tongue-iceland"	"Múlajökull is one of the glacial tongues that extends off the southeast portion of the of the Hofsjökull glacier system, the third largest in Iceland, located in the central highlands. Glacial tongues are long, narrow extensions of ice that flow down valleys or through mountain passes from larger ice caps or glaciers. The ice margin of the Múlajökull is characterised by unique geological formations, which alternate with a series of small lakes. The peculiar shape created by these formations is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 May 2023. Data from Copernicus satellites enable the study and monitoring of glaciers around the world."
"multiple-plumes-dust-and-sand-namib-desert"	"In the first decade of July 2023, strong winds carried multiple plumes of dust and sand from the Namib desert, located along the southwestern coast of Africa. These plumes can be seen drifting westward in a captivating display captured by a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite on 11 July. Such occurrences are not uncommon in this arid region, where dry and gusty winds can lift fine particles and transport them across vast distances, impacting air quality, visibility, and even weather patterns in the surrounding areas. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service enables global monitoring and forecasting of air quality, and delivers valuable insights into the composition and condition of the atmosphere to support environmental management and public health efforts worldwide."
"multiple-weather-phenomena-mediterranean-sea-end-september-2021"	"Over the last weekend of September 2021, the Mediterranean Sea was affected by an upsurge of Saharan dust associated with a heatwave that caused temperatures of above 35°C in Corsica. In addition to the dust, sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the island of La Palma, where the Cumbre Vieja volcano is currently erupting, was also present in Mediterranean skies, albeit at high altitudes. This image combines data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5P satellites on 26 September and provides evidence of both Saharan dust and SO2 en route to Italy. In addition to satellite observations, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) monitors and forecasts air quality on a global scale."

"multiple-wildfires-raging-mexico"	"Mexico is struggling with more than 30 active fires, which have already caused 4,000 hectares of forest to burn. Usually, the fire season in Mexico starts in April, but this year the wildfires have started affecting the country earlier, because of the extreme drought that is gripping the country in the areas of the Gulf of Mexico’s coast and in the north-west. In fact, the Mexican Government’s Drought Monitor has indicated that by 15 March, the rainfall was insufficient in more than 30% of the national territory. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 March 2022, shows the fire ongoing in the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve. The Mexican Space Agency has requested the activation of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) Rapid Rapping, in order to monitor the impact of the wildfire (Activation EMSR571)."
"musa-bay-iran"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 13 November, shows the Musa Bay in Iran. Musa bay is a shallow estuary with a long history as a shipping hub: in the classical age, Greek navigators used the area for trade with the peoples of Mesopotamia and today it hosts Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni (BEK), one of the most important port areas of Iran. The waters of the bay are pristine, with the exception of the BEK area where many crude oil refining facilities produce a wide variety of petroleum-based products and production waste causes pollution of the waters. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a high-resolution mission composed two identical satellites designed to provide optical imaging with a revisit frequency of 5 days. These satellites benefit Copernicus services and applications such as water quality monitoring or emergency management."
"nepal-engulfed-smoke-due-unprecedented-wildfires"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 March 2021, shows the valleys east of Nepal’s capital Kathmandu completely engulfed in smoke. For the second time in 2021, a thick layer of smoke has blanketed Nepal, causing a severe deterioration of air quality in the region. As the thickness of the smoke and haze reached extreme levels, the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu closed and begun to divert flights because of poor visibility. According to multiple sources, the situation came about due to the dozens of fires that have been raging in the area for weeks, and were exacerbated by the absence of rain during that period. Anil Pokhrel, Chief Executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority of Nepal, declared that the number of wildfires has been unprecedented, and a special programme has been launched by the Nepalese government to manage the evolving situation. Copernicus' Sentinel satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor fires and their impact on land, vegetation and air quality"

"new-massive-coral-bleaching-event-great-barrier-reef"	"The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has recently been affected by new coral bleaching episode, the fourth one since 2016. Coral bleaching happens when the animal is affected by above-average water temperatures causing the coral polyps to expel the algae that live inside their tissue and are responsible of the coral’s colour. Even though corals can survive bleaching events, this process heavily affects their wellbeing, making them more vulnerable to diseases, slowing their growth and, in severe cases, potentially leading to their death. This means that it will take a long time before the impact of this massive bleaching event can be fully assessed. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 March 2022, shows the reefs off the Whitsunday Islands, one of the regions most affected. An aerial survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority indicates that most reefs located in this area as suffering from severe bleaching, meaning that at least 60% of an individual reef’s corals were affected."
"new-morandi-bridge-italy"	"In the summer of 2018, the Morandi Bridge – a highway bridge in Genoa (Italy) - collapsed causing 43 fatalities. The event affected road traffic in the entire country. Therefore, the reconstruction works started shortly after the accident and continued even during the Covid-19 outbreak. On 28 April 2020, the last span of the new Morandi bridge was positioned. This image was acquired on May 1 using a Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite which carries a single C-band synthetic aperture radar instrument. It was the first radar image of the new Morandi bridge acquired by one of the Copernicus satellites.

"new-road-crossing-lava-flow-cumbre-vieja-eruption"	"The Cumbre Vieja volcano on the island of La Palma, Canarias, Spain, entered into an eruptive episode on 19 September 2021. The seismic activity connected to the eruption and the lava flow emitted changed the morphology of the island and caused great damage to numerous buildings and key infrastructure. Recently, a new road which is crossing the lava flow has been inaugurated. The 3.3 kilometres long track connects the north and south of the western part of the island (the part destroyed during the eruption) and the journey can be completed in just over ten minutes, whereas the alternative prior to its opening was a journey of over an hour and a half around the island. The new route, crossing the black lava flow, is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 July 2022. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service extensively supported the response to the Cumbre Vieja eruption, assessing the damage caused through the work of the Risk and Recovery and Rapid Mapping Teams."

"new-zealands-hottest-year-record"	"This image, acquired on 21 January 2022 by one of the Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the Southern Alps in New Zealand. Spanning approximately 650 kilometres along the South Island’s western coast, the Southern Alps are home to a number of glaciers. However, year after year, the effects of climate change have become increasingly apparent in this mountain range, as rising temperatures have caused significant glacial retreat, as well as in New Zealand more broadly. According to New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Aeronautic research, 2021 was New Zealand’s hottest year on record. In addition to exacerbating the melting of glaciers, these rising temperatures are the source of ever-more extreme weather events, according to scientists from the Victoria University of Wellington. The Copernicus component of the EU Space Programme is a vital source of information for climate scientists around the world, from data on global temperatures to monitoring of glacial retreat."

"nile-delta"	"The Nile Delta region, home to about one quarter of Egypt’s population, is vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The area is in fact vulnerable to periodic flooding, which is caused by the rise of the Mediterranean Sea and its consequent spill over the lowlands around the villages of the region. This severely affects the local population by destroying homes and saturating farmland with saltwater, thus hindering the cultivation of arable crops. The ongoing construction of multiple coastal dykes aims to prevent the regular flooding affecting various governorates of the region. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 March 2022, shows the dykes built along the coast of the Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, one of the most severely affected by coastal floods."
"nitrogen-dioxide-and-carbon-monoxide-levels-over-india"	"While winter is getting closer, the air hanging over India, especially on the north, thickens with smoke from stubble burning, mainly in the state of Punjab, blocking out the sun and making it hard to breathe. Temperatures are falling and pollution is spiking across major cities including the capital New Delhi, one of the worst-affected areas for smog from the agricultural fires. Delhi’s residents haven’t had a single day of clean air since early September, according to the World Air Quality Index, and in the last two weeks the values of measured PM2.5 have risen more than eight times above safe levels. Even if pollution is worsened by vehicle and industrial emissions, in the state of Punjab crop burning has grown exponentially since September 2020, so that the transport of smoke has been reported by satellites in different parts of the country, including southern India, reaching even the Arabian Sea. These two maps have been obtained with the data retrieved by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission and show the concentration of atmospheric pollutants over India, on 3 November 2020, for two different trace gases: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). While both the maps clearly show a poor air quality situation in different states across the country, the CO map clearly highlights the role of the smoke originating from the burning crops in northern India. The Sentinel-5P mission is the first Copernicus mission dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere The mission consists of one satellite carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument that performs atmospheric measurements with high spatio-temporal resolution and a global daily revisit time. The data products derived from its measurements have been specifically designed to be used for air quality, ozone & UV radiation, and climate monitoring & forecasting."

It is located just under 120 km from the Arctic Ocean and 70 km south of the northernmost fire ever detected by satellite. The blaze developed during a period of a strong thermal anomaly across Arctic Siberia, with persistent positive temperature anomalies of more than 15°C. Open data supplied by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission allows monitoring and mapping the effects of wildfires at all latitudes."
"northernmost-fire-2020-date"	"Wildfires are ravaging several areas of Siberia, including those inside the Arctic Circle. While fires are common at this time of year, record temperatures and strong winds are making the situation particularly worrying. Satellite data are extremely useful to detect fires and to monitor hotspots. In 2019, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites detected what is believed to be the northernmost wildfire in recent years, 30 km west of Taymylyr in the Republic of Sakha. This year, a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imaged a fire further north (Latitude 72.723° N, Longitude 118.12° E), 12 km north of the 2019 fire and only 50 km from the Arctic Ocean. The European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites use infrared sensing capabilities to detect active fires, subject to cloud cover. Moreover, data derived from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites’ measurements can provide estimates of the fire radiative power (FRP). This parameter is related to the amount of organic material a given fire is burning and to the amount of smoke it is releasing. The combined use of data derived from these Copernicus satellites can provide important improvements in terms of monitoring and understanding the impact of climate change."

"offshore-earthquake-causes-further-damage-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power"	"This image, acquired by one of the Sentinel-2 satellites on 13 February 2021, shows the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan just hours before a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck the region. The epicentre of the earthquake was east of Honshu in the Pacific Ocean, and not far from the epicentre of the earthquake that caused the devastating tsunami of 2011. While it led to the injury of almost 200 people, the 13 February earthquake did not produce excess damage to buildings or other infrastructure, but it led to issues at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Keisuke Matsuo, spokesperson for Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), confirmed that the earthquake had aggravated existing damage in the primary containment chambers of reactor Units 1 and 3, causing further leakage of cooling water. According to TEPCO, which is managing the plant, the leaked radioactive water is expected to have remained within the reactor buildings without reaching the outside. Nevertheless, the unexpected event further complicates the already complex decommissioning process of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which started after the tsunami of March 2011. Open Data supplied by Copernicus Satellites and Services allow for a fast response to emergencies and disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes."

It is home to various species of fauna, including polar bears, moose, and wolves, as well as countless migratory birds from around the world that visit it each year. The region first became a federal protected area in 1960, and the ANWR was established in two decades later, via the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. However, the United States Congress deferred the decision regarding management of oil and gas exploration in a coastal plain discussed in section 1002 (referred to as the 1002 area). This area spans about 600,000 ha and — despite its importance as a wildlife habitat — has been a subject of ongoing discussion due to the enormous oil and gas resources it is suspected to contain. No decisions were made regarding oil exploration in the 1002 area until 2017, when a tax legislation that would allow for oil and gas drilling was signed into law. Numerous disputes followed this decision, but in February 2021, all exploration plans are reported to have finally fizzled out due to their lack of measures to ensure protection of the polar bear habitats of the ANWR. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 July 2020, shows the city of Kaktovik in the 1002 area, around which seismic surveys were planned. Data acquired by Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used operationally to monitor the impact of climate change on the fragile ecosystems in the Arctic."
"oil-spill-coast-syria"	"On 24 and 25 August 2021, the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites have imaged an oil spill on the coast of Syria. According to media reports, the oil spill started as a consequence of a leakage in a power plant inside a refinery in the Syrian town of Baniyas, on the Mediterranean coast. The image from 24 August 2021 shows that the massive leakage had reached the town of Jableh, 20 km north of Baniyas. In the next day’s image, we can see that the spill has progressed northwards further polluting coastal waters. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites are a unique open data remote sensing tool for sea and ocean waters oil spill detection and monitoring."
"oil-spill-mauritius"	"On 25 July 2020, the bulk carrier MV Wakashio was sailing near Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, carrying 200 tons of diesel and 3,800 tons of fuel but due severe weather ran aground in front of Pointe d'Esny, one of the most important tourist destinations on the island. Over the last few days, the ship has begun to spill oil into the sea, with potentially serious damage to the environment of the island country. As a consequence, on 7 August the Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth declared a state of environmental emergency. This collage composed of two images acquired on 1 and 6 August 2020 by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the bulk carrier stranded near the reef (on the left) and the oil spill (on the right). Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission. The mission specification of the twin satellites is designed to provide a revisit frequency of 5 days. These twin satellites benefit Copernicus services and applications such as water quality monitoring or emergency management."
"oil-spill-mauritius-new-image-16-august"	"This image, acquired on 16 August 2020 at 6:35 UTC by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the bulk carrier MV Wakashio, stranded since 25 July off the coast of Mauritius broken into two parts. After the oil spill documented on 6 and 11 August by images previously acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, there are no visible signs of new spills in this latest image."
"oil-spill-morrocoy-national-park-venezuela"	"The coast of Venezuela has been affected by a severe oil spill in the summer of 2020: official sources report that between 19 and 22 July, about 22 thousand barrels of oil leaked into the sea from the El Palito refinery, in the state of Falcón. The Morrocoy National Park is among the affected areas. It is known for its pristine beaches and the richness of its ecosystem, which includes mangroves, corals and turtles, as well as the Cuare Wildlife Refuge. This collage composed of two images acquired on 5 and 20 August 2020 by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows, on 5 August, the contaminated waters around the island of Cayo Borracho in the Morrocoy National Park (top image) and, on 20 August, visible oil slicks around El Palito (bottom image). The Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a high-resolution mission composed two identical satellites designed to provide imaging with a revisit frequency of 5 days. These satellites benefit Copernicus services and applications such as water quality monitoring or emergency management."
"oil-spill-port-louis-mauritius"	"The island country of Mauritius is currently dealing with a second major oil spill, following one that occurred on 6 August after the sinking of the Japanese vessel Wakashio. The new oil spill, this time on land, has been going on since last week. It was caused by a leak in a heavy fuel oil pipeline and storage tanks that had been storing oil from MS Wakashio in the capital city of Port Louis. According to official reports, about 15 cubic meters of heavy oil have leaked through the pipes, 11 of which have been removed. Even though it has been declared that there is no danger for the coastal maritime zone, the pipeline leak is nevertheless just over a mile from an important Ramsar-protected bird sanctuary, the Terre Rouge River Estuary Bird sanctuary. It is still unclear how harmful the spill is for this area. This true colour image was captured on 14 November by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites and shows the oil spill area in the city of Port Louis. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a high-resolution mission composed of two identical satellites designed to provide multispectral imagery with a revisit frequency of 5 days. The satellites enable Copernicus to offer services and applications such as water quality monitoring or environmental emergency management."
"oil-tanker-yemen-coast"	"On 15 July 2020, the United Nations warned that an abandoned oil storage and offloading tanker, the FSO Safer, moored off the coast of Yemen and laden with more than 1 million barrels of crude oil, is at risk of leaking oil or of being caught in cross fire from the ongoing civil war. According to the UN Environment Programme, an oil spill would cause massive environmental damage to marine life, desalination factories and international shipping routes. FSO Safer carries four times more oil than the Exxon Valdez which caused an unprecedented ecological catastrophe in Alaska in 1989. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 June 2020, shows the tanker moored 23 km southeast of As Salif, in the Red Sea. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission is a constellation of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. The first satellite, Sentinel-2A has been launched in 2015, while the launch of Sentinel-2B took place in 2016: their revisit time is 5 days, a value that is considerably lower than the one of other medium to high resolution optical satellite constellations. Its imagery, accessible on a full, free and open basis, enables regular and global monitoring of environmental phenomena and emergency situations."
"oil-tankers-parked-outside-ports-long-beach-california"	"Due to the reduced demand for crude oil products stemming from the COVID-19 stay-at-home measures around the world, many tankers have nowhere to deliver their oil. For this reason, there has been an unusual stationing of oil tankers at major US ports and this has triggered government agencies to monitor any spillage that may occur. This image acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 23 April shows numerous oil tankers parked outside the ports of Long Beach, California. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites are particularly suitable to study and monitor oil spill events."
"olenek-river-russia"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 May 2020 shows the delta of the Olenek River and the Olenek Gulf at the beginning of the spring thaw. The Olenek river is a major river in the northern region of Siberian Russia, located in the Sakha Republic. The river is frozen for over eight months every year and the climate in this area is directly influenced by the Arctic. The thaw generally begins in the last weeks of spring and in this false colour image the river appears in red tones because it is currently thawing, while the wide black areas show us discharged sediments already thawed and making their way to the Olenëk gulf. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect changes in land surfaces in high detail at northern latitudes and monitor the permafrost thaw."
"olive-groves-greece-threatened-warming-temperatures"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 December 2021, shows an area of the Kalamata region in Greece; renowned worldwide for its olive groves. The annual olive harvests, which occur in the late autumn, this year faced a new threat. Rising local temperatures in spring (up to 38 degrees Celsius) and the extreme heatwave that affected the Mediterranean basin in the summer have dried up the olive trees, reducing the yield of the harvests. According to local farmers, this amounts to an estimated 50 per cent drop in the total regional output, substantially impacting the Greek olive oil industry. Data obtained from Copernicus Sentinel satellites contribute to monitoring the threats to agricultural activities from climate change. In particular, these data are helpful in understanding rising temperature trends, wildfire occurrences and impacts, as well as other environmental factors."
"ongoing-drought-affecting-water-supply-mexico"	"Various drought events are affecting Europe and the rest of the world. Mexico is going through a historic water shortage caused by the drought that is currently gripping the country. In Monterrey, the capital of the north-eastern Mexican state of Nuevo León, home to more than one million inhabitants, water rationing has been enacted. According to the media, some disadvantaged neighbourhoods have not had running water in their faucets for 50 days. These images were acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 July 2022 and show the city of Monterrey and the La Boca reservoir, one of the main sources of water supply for the city. The ongoing drought conditions have caused a severe water deficit in the reservoir, which is now almost completely dry. The yellow outline in the image indicates the surface of the La Boca reservoir at full capacity. Open data retrieved from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide key information which useful to accurately map water bodies and extract critical information during periods of drought."
"ongoing-eruption-karymsky-volcano"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 19 April 2022, shows the ashfall traces resulting from the ongoing eruption of the Karymsky volcano. Karymsky is the most volcano active in the eastern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula and has had a persistent activity for 500 years. On 21 April 2022, a few days after the acquisition of this image, a massive emission of ash reached an altitude of almost 10 km, as a result of the ongoing eruption. The volcanic ash plume is now moving northeast at a speed of 25 knots (46 km/h). The data gathered by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites – particularly by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 – allow the monitoring of remote volcanoes around the world."
"ongoing-severe-drought-northern-italy"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 March 2022, shows the border between the Piemonte and Lombardia regions in Northern Italy, where the cities of Milan, Novara and Pavia are located. This area is currently confronted with a severe drought, as a consequence of insufficient precipitations and warmer than average temperatures, with a high probability of negative effects on the local agricultural sector. In fact, the 2021/2022 winter was the sixth driest in 63 years, while the flow of the Po, the most important river in Italy, is currently at its lowest level in 30 years. The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, which provide drought indicators and early warning for droughts in Europe (EDO) and worldwide (GDO)."
"ongoing-wildfire-veneto-italy"	"During the night between Tuesday 22 March and Wednesday 23 March, a forest fire started spreading on a mountain area near Belluno and Treviso in Veneto in Northern Italy. The wildfire has considerably spread despite the firefighters’ efforts, and the use of water bombers. In fact, the drought that has been affecting Northern Italy for the past months is likely to have contributed to the rapid spreading of the fire and has affected the water bombers’ operations, as low water levels in the nearby Piave river did not allow to use it for water resupply, forcing the aircraft to replenish at the further away Santa Croce lake. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 March 2022, shows the resulting engulfing the area and severely affecting the local air quality."
"ongoing-wildfires-antalya-region-republic-turkiye"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 August 2021, shows the two largest active wildfires in the Antalya region of Republic of Türkiye, one near Manavgat and the other near Gündoğmuş. Eight days after the beginning of the crisis caused by the extremely violent fires in the southern part of Republic of Türkiye, 16 blazes are still active. There are eight fatalities and 58 people have been injured. According to Turkish Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli, a total of 16 water-bombers, 9 drones, 45 helicopters and about 5,250 firefighters are involved in the battle against the fire. In the fire-fighting operations, firefighting resources from Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran are involved, as well as the Canadair water bombers made available by the European Union. Data from the Copernicus missions allow the demarcation of burnt areas in high resolution."
"open-water-laptev-sea"	"This mosaic, consisting of multiple images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 31 May 2021 provides evidence of the early absence of sea ice in the Laptev Sea. Sea ice in the Russian Arctic Ocean usually begins to melt in early June. As this image shows, two large areas of open water were already present in the Laptev Sea at the time this image was acquired. In addition, the remaining shoreline sea ice has taken on a blue colour. In the special false-colour visualisation used for this image, blue indicates that the sea ice is close to complete fracturing. The open data provided by Copernicus products and services allow for the development of authoritative assessments of the state of sea ice coverage worldwide."
"oslofjord-norway"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 November shows the Oslofjord, the largest fjord of Norway. Fjords are oblong inlets which in most cases formed as the sea flooded glacial valleys. The Oslofjord, the largest in Norway, however, is not really a fjord but a rift valley where, more than 300 million years ago, volcanic activity and tectonic forces have slowly wrenched apart the Earth’s crust, allowing the sea to creep inland for over 80 km and ending where the capital Oslo stands today. The Copernicus Sentinel missions allow the monitoring of coastal zones such as fjords, estuaries and lagoons by providing data on the behaviour, the use and the status of these fragile ecosystems."
"out-season-fires-arctic-circle"	"In 2020, Siberia experienced one of the most dramatic summers on record due to a number of mega wildfires and severe heatwaves that affected the region. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), September 2020 was the warmest September on record. In particular, temperatures were exceptionally high for September in the Arctic portion of Siberia and in the Arctic Ocean, reaching anomalies of +6-10°C. As consequence, the exceptional Arctic fire season in Siberia is not yet over. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 October 2020, shows two hot spots still active in the Arctic circle. These hot spots are caused by forest fires, and are located in an area of Siberia (68.284 N, 152.545E) where the water of thermokarst lakes has started to freeze. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, provides multispectral data over 13 different spectral bands with a maximum spatial resolution of 10m and a maximum revisit time of 5 days. Thanks to these specifications, the Sentinel-2 data can be used for operational applications in the field of wildfire detection and monitoring."
"out-season-melting-ice-cap-greenland"	"A severe and out-of-season heat wave affected Greenland in early September. In some areas of western Greenland, the air temperature anomaly was 15°C higher than the reference value, resulting in a significant melting of the ice cap. According to climatologists of the University of Liège, this episode is the most important melting event of the 2021-2022 season. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 4 September 2022, shows meltwaters flowing over the ice cap of southwest Greenland. The Copernicus Sentinels satellite missions play an important role in Arctic monitoring."
"panamas-gardi-sugdub-islands-population-displaced-because-sea-level-rise"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 November 2022, shows Gardi Sugdub, in Panama. It is a tiny island in the Caribbean Sea and a part of the San Blas archipelago, which comprises 365 islands, mostly uninhabited. Gardi Sugdub, however, is home to 1,200 indigenous Guna people, who will soon be displaced to the mainland because of the sea level rise induced by climate change. The further movement of inhabitants from the surrounding islands is foreseen to be necessary by 2050. Data from Copernicus Sentinel satellites are key to better understand and monitor climate change, and to develop mitigation and adaptation measures."
"parana-river-reaches-lowest-november-level-25-years"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 November 2021, shows the Paraná River near Corrientes in Argentina. The basin that feeds the Parana River is facing one of the worst droughts in decades. According to the Institute of Water and Environment of Argentina, the level of the river continues to fall due to the absence of rain. According to the latest measurements in Corrientes, the level of the Paraná River in the last week of November 2021 was 2.64 metres below the monthly November average of the last 25 years. With an average revisit time of five days at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide free and open data that can be used to monitor droughts and their impact on ecosystems."
"partial-solar-eclipse-northern-hemisphere"	"On 25 October 2022, a partial solar eclipse was visible in the Northern Hemisphere. This astronomical event occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, partly covering it. This partial solar eclipse was the second one in 2022 and was considered to be the most significant one of the past seven years, with the Moon covering more than 50% of the solar disk in northern Norway. At the eclipse’s maximum, at 10:12 UTC, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites acquired this unique image, showing the shadow of the moon projected over the northernmost part of the Scandinavian peninsula."
"partially-sunk-bulk-carrier-close-gibraltar"	"On 29 August 2022, a bulk carrier partially sank in the bay of Gibraltar after a collision with a gas tanker, causing an oil spill that polluted part of the surrounding coastal areas. At the moment, almost all the oil spilt has been recovered. The OS 35 bulk carrier is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 5 September 2022. The combined use of radar and optical data acquired by Copernicus satellites provides useful information that can be applied to maritime surveillance activities around the world."
"patagonia-covered-snow"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 23 August 2021, shows part of Patagonia covered in snow. At the end of August, South America was meteorologically divided into two parts. In the north of Argentina, several historical records for air temperatures for August were registered, such as 36.8°C in Ituzaingó, in the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. Meanwhile, a storm hit Patagonia. It brought a heavy snowfall that covered the Andes and part of the province of Santa Cruz in Argentina. One casualty and many traffic disruptions were caused by the snowstorm. Launched in 2016 and 2018, the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are providing critical information on climate change by monitoring our oceans, glaciers, and atmosphere to constantly improve our understanding of large-scale global dynamics."
"patagonia-heatwave-argentina-chile"	"A strong heatwave is affecting Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula in the second week of February, with temperatures 10°C higher than average values of the period. In Punta Arenas, one of the major cities in the southern Chilean Patagonia, temperature has risen up to 25°, while the typical maximum value is about 15°C. According to the experts of the Dirección Meteorológica de Chile (DMC), this phenomenon is due to high pressure that allows the influx of warm subtropical air. Heatwaves are not unusual events in Patagonia, but their frequency is increasing every year. 2020 had been characterised by a lower number of heatwaves in the region, due to the presence of La Niña, but models suggest a new increase for the summer of 2021. These high temperatures result from a complex climatic situation, and they are mainly a consequence of the global warming according to climatologists from the University of Chile. This image shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST) map over Patagonia as recorded by the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 Satellites on 11 February 2021 LST is the temperature of the soil and should not be confused with the air temperature at ground level. This is why it is not possible to measure the temperature of the soil in areas covered by clouds. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellite (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are both equipped with the Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, an instrument whose main objective is to provide global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) with a very high level of accuracy (for both climatological and meteorological applications)."
"peak-deforestation-brazil"	"These images, acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on October 23, 2020 and October 3, 2021 provide evidence of new deforested areas near Castelo de Sonhos, in the state of Para' in Brazil. The Amazon rain forest is one of the world's most biodiverse areas and a vital carbon sink that slows the pace of global warming. According to the latest data from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (INPE), an estimated 13,235 square kilometres of rainforest have been lost in 2020-21, representing a 22% increase in the deforestation rate over one year, the highest since 2006. The high revisit frequency of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites supports the attempts to mitigate deforestation by providing greater opportunities to acquire cloud-free optical data. This is of particular benefit at tropical latitudes, where heavy cloud cover has previously delayed the potential acquisition of a complete coverage of the areas of interest."
"peatland-wildfire-sutherland-scotland-uk"	"In May 2019, a wildfire burned for six days affecting more than 5,300 hectares of peatland in Sutherland, Scotland. The emissions from carbon loss are estimated to be in the range of 174 to 294 kilotons of C. This area, known as the Flow Country, is home to the largest continuous blanket bog in Europe. The European Union and the United Kingdom both adhere to key international peatland-related international agreements such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. As more awareness is raised on the importance of peatlands and their vulnerability, more efforts have been made and research is conducted to protect and monitor this unique, carbon-rich soil that serves as a habitat for numerous and biodiverse species. This false colour image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 May 2019, highlights the smoke from the fire in red tones. Copernicus Sentinel imagery and its frequent revisit time are essential for detecting changes in our environment and monitoring the restoration of peatlands at scale. Image processed by Keiko Nomura (@Keiko_geo on Twitter)."
"peatlands-dingle-peninsula-ireland"	"Peatlands contain more carbon than all the world's forests. According to a paper published in Nature Climate Change by researchers from the University of Exeter and Texas A&M University, preserving the world's peatlands—and the vast carbon stores they contain—is vitally important to limit climate change. As a result of climate change impacts, it is expected that peatlands will become source of carbon in this century after acting as a carbon sequestration facility for millennia. This is why they should be included in the main Earth System Models used for climate projections. This false colour image was created using data acquired by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel 2 satellites on 20 September 2020 and shows the Dingle Peninsula, located in the South West region of Ireland. The peninsula contains a vast area of Atlantic blanket bog peatlands, visible as the orange areas in the image. The Atlantic blanket bog vegetation has a characteristically grassy appearance due to the presence of purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) and black bog rush. It is typical of the landscape on the Irish west coast. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission is composed of two twin satellites that are equipped with a multispectral sensor providing data in 13 different spectral bands. With a maximum revisit time of five days, the Sentinel-2 mission is very useful for monitoring the impact of climate change on peatlands and helping to preserve such an important and fragile ecosystem."
"pechora-river-russia"	"Phytoplankton form the base of both marine and freshwater ecosystems, including that of the Arctic Ocean, and their abundance is strongly tied to the presence or absence of nutrients. According to a study focussed on the Arctic Ocean published in the Nature Communications scientific journal, more nutrients than was previously thought originate from continental sources. In particular, these nutrients stem from coastal erosion and river discharge, and not from the diminishing amounts of sea ice and changes in ocean circulation. This discovery suggests that, despite the climatic changes that affect ecosystems at high latitudes, fisheries of the Arctic Ocean will not experience major disruptions. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 July 2020, shows the delta of the Pechora River in Russia, one of the six major rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean, and which were studied to achieve this important result. Data retrieved by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service can be used to plan sustainable fishery activities."
"penguin-island-antarctica"	"The Penguin Island is a small volcanic island in Antarctica. It is an important nesting area and is home to a wide range of seabirds. The Copernicus Sentinel-2A satellite acquired this rare cloud-free image of the island at the end of February 2022."
"penuelas-lake-chile-has-dried"	"The Peñuelas Lake, located 120 kilometres west of Santiago, was one of the main sources of water supply for the Valparaíso region in Chile. Together with the Los Aromos lake, it supplies water to almost two million inhabitants of the Valparaíso region, and supports the local fauna, which is now struggling to survive. In fact, because of the multiannual drought that is affecting Chile, the lake has now almost completely dried up. According to the latest report by the Valparaíso Sanitation Company, the Peñuelas Lake current capacity barely reaches 170 thousand cubic meters, which amount to only 0 .2% of its total capacity of 95 million cubic meters. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 April 2016 (left) and 24 March 2022 (right) show the dramatic effects of the drought on the Peñuelas Lake, which now looks almost completely dry."
"permafrost-melting-causes-landslide-alaskas-denali-national-park"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 September 2021, shows the Denali National Park (Alaska – USA), where a climate change–induced landslide caused the closure of the only road that crosses the park. The landslide, known as the Pretty Rocks Landslide, has been active for decades, but between 21 July and 25 August 2021, it accelerated to the point that the Denali Park Road became unpassable, forcing park authorities to shut it down. The closure has completely disrupted tourism and has caused multi-million dollar damages to the local economy. According to National Park Service experts, the cause of the landslide is climate change, which causes the melting of the permafrost on which the road is built. Data from the Copernicus missions allow monitoring of landslide-related ground movements with millimetre accuracy."
"persistent-extreme-heatwave-southern-asia"	"Southern Asia, one of the most densely populated regions of the world, is currently going through an intense heatwave: the extreme heat is impacting the lives and health of hundreds of millions of people, threatening entire ecosystems. On 1 May 2022, when this image was acquired, the air temperature reached 49.5°C in Nawabshah (Pakistan) and 47.1°C in Bikaner (India). On the same day, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the area reached peaks of 62°C as highlighted in this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image. (NB: The high air temperatures are reflected in land surface temperature values. The LST is the temperature of the soil and should not be confused with air temperature). The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) both equipped with the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, an instrument whose main objective is to provide Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST)."
"phytoplankton-bloom-arctic-ocean-july-2023"	"On 26 July 2023, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured a seasonal phytoplankton bloom off the west coast of the Svalbard Archipelago, in the Arctic Ocean. Phytoplankton blooms are an explosion of microscopic plant-like organisms that thrive in nutrient-rich waters. These blooms play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as the primary food source for various marine species, including fish and whales. Such blooms are often triggered by a combination of factors, such as increased sunlight, warm temperatures, and increased nutrient availability. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow for monitoring of ocean colour. This monitoring is crucial for understanding changes in phytoplankton levels and the health of marine ecosystems, providing crucial information for the sustainable management of marine resources and the comprehension of global climate cycles."
"phytoplankton-bloom-atlantic-ocean"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 22 March 2021, shows a phytoplankton bloom 400 km southeast of the island of Newfoundland in Canada. Phytoplankton blooms are usually observed in this part of the Atlantic Ocean in midsummer when cold water from the Labrador Sea converges with warm water transported by the Gulf Stream. These conditions support the proliferation of nutrients needed to sustain them. The phytoplankton bloom shown in this image is probably supported by the presence of nutrients that are likely to stem from the absence of sea ice and the anomalously high air and sea surface temperatures of this mild winter. By measuring the colour of the ocean, Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow for the monitoring and detailed study of the properties and dynamics of the biogeochemical constituents of the oceans."
"phytoplankton-bloom-barents-sea"	"Phytoplankton are marine microscopic plant-like organisms that need sunlight to thrive. During the summer of 2020, the high insolation levels associated to severe heatwaves that have affected high latitudes, have led to numerous phytoplankton blooms in many ice-free areas of the Arctic Ocean. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 21 August 2020, shows a bloom of Phytoplankton in the Barents Sea, north of Scandinavia and Russia. Availability of Phytoplankton in the oceans is an indicator of the health of a marine ecosystem: data retrieved by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow to monitor the availability of Phytoplankton in the ocean and the water quality."
"phytoplankton-bloom-black-sea"	"Most summers, jewel-toned hues appear in the Black Sea. The turquoise swirls are not the brushstrokes of a painting, they indicate the presence of phytoplankton, which trace the flow of water currents and eddies. On 10 May 2020, the Copernicus Sentinel-3B satellite captured an ongoing phytoplankton bloom in the Black Sea. Phytoplankton are floating, microscopic organisms that make their own food through photosynthesis and also from absorbing dissolved nutrients in the sea water. Here, ample water flow from rivers, such as the Danube river, carry nutrients to the Black Sea. In general, phytoplankton support fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms as they are at the base of the food chain, one reason being, the waste product of photosynthesis is oxygen But large, frequent blooms can lead to eutrophication—the loss of oxygen from the water—and this ends up suffocating marine life. Measuring ocean colour, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allow us to capture, monitor and better understand marine life, their biological constituents and their activity."
"phytoplankton-bloom-bristol-channel"	"This image, acquired on 27 May 2022 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows a phytoplankton bloom in the Bristol Channel. Phytoplankton is responsible for most of the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean, as well as for producing part of the oxygen we breathe. Phytoplankton blooms are quite common in the northern hemisphere in spring and summer, as the increased sunlight and warmer temperatures cause the proliferation of nutrients needed to sustain them. By measuring ocean colour, Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites allow for the monitoring and detailed study of the properties and dynamics of the biogeochemical constituents of the marine environment."
"phytoplankton-bloom-english-channel"	"On 23 June one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites acquired this stunning view of a phytoplankton bloom in the English Channel. Phytoplankton are microscopic plant-like organisms that grow, multiply, and drift in the sunlit surface waters of most bodies of water on Earth. Phytoplankton represent the base of the ocean’s food chain: most species contain chlorophyll and produce energy via photosynthesis. When present in high concentrations in the water, the chlorophyll in their bodies gives the water a greenish colour. Other phytoplankton species produce secretions composed of calcium carbonate. In high concentrations, these secretions can give a the water a light turquoise colour. When the conditions are right, the phytoplankton population can grow explosively – a phenomenon that is known as a bloom. Blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem, and therefore, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions provide continuous, high frequency water quality monitoring of coastal waters."
"phytoplankton-bloom-indian-ocean"	"Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that grow in the sunlit surface waters of the ocean. When their concentration reaches a certain level, the bloom becomes visible from space. This is what occurred on 12 December 2021, when a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite captured this bloom about 100 kilometres off the coast of western Tasmania (Australia). As well as colouring ocean waters, phytoplankton play an important role in sustaining ocean ecosystems, forming the basis of the ocean food chain, and by consequence in stabilising the global climate. Monitoring phytoplankton is essential to studying the impact of climate change on the oceans. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites offer unique possibilities for monitoring the biogeochemical state of the ocean and understanding changes in marine ecosystems."
"phytoplankton-bloom-napoli-gulf"	"On 9 July 2023, the waters of the Gulf of Naples in Italy took on an unusual green colour, catching the attention of locals and experts alike. The phenomenon was attributed to a non-toxic algal bloom, specifically caused by a type of microalgae known as prasinophytes. The bloom persisted for several days and was observed by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 11 July. Copernicus Marine Service provides valuable data and tools for monitoring coastal water quality, enabling better understanding and management of marine ecosystems and aiding decision-making processes to ensure the health and sustainability of coastal environments."
"phytoplankton-bloom-north-sea-april-2021"	"This image, acquired by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 16 April 2021, shows a springtime phytoplankton bloom in the North Sea. Phytoplankton blooms occur at the time of year when large amounts of nutrients are present in the sea water, and there is strong sunlight. Despite its cold waters, the North Sea is an ideal basin for these blooms due to the combination of the presence of abundant nutrients and intense Arctic winds that favour the mixing of waters. Blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem. Therefore, the ability to monitor them is a crucial component of effective management of coastal and ocean resources. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions provide high-frequency monitoring of water quality in coastal waters."
"phytoplankton-bloom-norways-hardangerfjord"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 May 2022, shows a phytoplankton bloom in the Hardangerfjord in Norway. Starting from the Atlantic Ocean and stretching for 179 kilometres inland, it is Norway’s second-longest fjord. The increased sunlight in spring and warmer temperatures increase the probability of phytoplankton blooms, a common phenomenon at northern latitudes during this period of the year. In Europe, they are especially frequent in the North Sea, colouring the waters with vibrant turquoise colours. Phytoplankton blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem. Therefore, the ability to monitor them is a crucial component of the effective management of coastal and ocean resources. Data from Copernicus satellite missions allow the detection and monitoring of different types of algal blooms and of water quality levels."
"phytoplankton-bloom-ross-sea-antarctica"	"Seasons in the Ross Sea are marked by ice freezing and melting, and these processes mix the seawater while redistributing salt and nutrients. During the austral spring and summer, the influx of nutrients along the coastal area of Antarctica turns the water green as a consequence of massive phytoplankton blooms. These blooms are so large that they can be seen by satellites: this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 17 January 2021, show a massive phytoplankton bloom (~200 km long) near the Drygalski ice tongue. Blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem, and their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. The Copernicus Sentinel missions provide high frequency data useful for monitoring water quality of coastal waters."
"phytoplankton-bloom-southeast-sable-island-atlantic-ocean"	"This image, acquired by one of Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 15 May 2021, shows a massive phytoplankton bloom southeast of Sable Island in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Phytoplankton blooms are usually observed in this part of the Atlantic Ocean in spring and midsummer when the cold water of the Labrador Sea mixes with the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The bloom shown in this image captured by Sentinel-3 is quite extensive: it stretches for about 500 km in a north-easterly direction, probably following the currents of the the Gulf Stream. The availability of phytoplankton in the oceans is an indicator of the health of a marine ecosystem. Data retrieved by Copernicus' Sentinel-3 satellites allow to monitor the presence of phytoplankton in the ocean and to assess water quality."
"phytoplankton-bloom-southern-hemisphere"	"Phytoplankton are microscopic, plant-like organisms that use chlorophyll to harness sunlight for energy creation. They are critically important to the global carbon cycle and key producers of the oxygen that is essential to life and ecosystems. Conditions for phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Hemisphere are just right in the spring and summer seasons (roughly from October to February). This cloud-free image of the Southern Atlantic Ocean was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 24 November 2020. It shows a very large phytoplankton bloom located between the coasts of Argentina and the Falkland Islands which spans roughly 600km. Phytoplankton blooms are indicators of the health of a marine ecosystem, and, therefore, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission provides continuous and high-frequency monitoring of oceanic water quality. [SO1]One mission - 2 satellites"
"phytoplankton-bloom-southwest-iceland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 23 June 2021, shows a large phytoplankton bloom southwest of Iceland. Every year, a massive phytoplankton bloom spreads across the North Atlantic, moving from south to north and peaking in late spring. The abundance of sunlight and the warming of the sea surface layers allow phytoplankton to multiply in the upper layers of ocean waters. Phytoplankton is not only the basis of the ocean trophic chain but also an indicator of climate change as it transforms the carbon stored in the oceans and releases a significant portion of it into the atmosphere. According to a study published in Nature, the number and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms will increase by up to 50 % by 2100, contributing, albeit indirectly, to global warming. The satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission provide high-resolution data on a daily basis, allowing the monitoring of algal blooms in the oceans."
"phytoplankton-blooms-north-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 25 June 2023, shows the intricate swirls from phytoplankton blooms in the North Sea. The blooms take on various shades, ranging from emerald green to turquoise, creating a visually captivating tableau against the deep blue of the surrounding water. Phytoplankton contribute to the cycle of marine nutrients, playing a key role in maintaining the overall balance and productivity of marine ecosystems. The existence and abundance of phytoplankton are not only crucial for marine life but also, as they produce oxygen and capture carbon, have far-reaching implications for the entire planet, emphasising the need to protect and sustain these invaluable organisms. Monitoring phytoplankton is critical for understanding the effects of climate change on the oceans. Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites provide data for monitoring changes in the marine environment."
"phytoplankton-blooms-northern-atlantic-ocean"	"This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 4 June 2023, shows phytoplankton blooms painting vibrant streaks off the coasts of France and Britain. These tiny powerhouses silently run the Earth's ecosystems, producing about half of the world’s oxygen. They serve as the foundation of the marine food web and support the survival of countless marine organisms. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide an invaluable contribution to the studying and monitoring of water quality and marine life."
"pico-faial-and-sao-jorge-islands"	"The Azores archipelago in Portugal is a stunning collection of nine islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Among them are Pico, Faial, and São Jorge, three islands known for their rich biodiversity and for being home to unique species found nowhere else on Earth. On 3 April 2023, one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured an image of these islands, showcasing their lush green vegetation surrounded by blue waters. Pico Island boasts a massive volcanic peak and unique flora, while Faial Island is famous for its colourful hydrangea flowers and diverse marine life. São Jorge Island features cliffs and deep valleys, providing habitat to many unique plant and animal species. Copernicus provides valuable satellite data that is used to monitor and protect the unique biodiversity and ecosystems of the Azores archipelago, supporting conservation efforts and sustainable development projects in the region."
"pine-island-glacier"	"Pine Island is one of the largest and fastest-changing glaciers in Antarctica. Its shelf is becoming increasingly fragile due to Climate Change. If it melted completely, it would contribute significantly to sea level rise. Copernicus Sentinel-1 image of 27 September."
"plastic-pollution-affecting-remote-arctic-ecosystems"	"According to a study recently published in the Nature scientific journal, plastic pollution is becoming pervasive in the Arctic, even reaching remote areas with no human settlements. Globally, plastic debris and microplastics have infiltrated terrestrial and marine ecosystems, the cryosphere and the atmosphere. In the Arctic, the study argues that the plastic pollution levels detected are partly generated by local human activities (such as fisheries), but distant regions are found to be a significant source of pollution as plastic is carried by ocean currents. The data analysed in the study were sourced from different Arctic ecosystems. One of the extraction points is the Ilulissat Icefjord, visible in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 2 May 2022. It is located on the west coast of Greenland, 250 km north of the Arctic Circle, and is one of the most active glaciers in the world. For its outstanding and universal value, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. Remote regions, such as the Arctic, are very fragile. The Copernicus satellite data allow researchers to study and monitor their environmental condition, as well as assess the effects of pollution and climate change on them."
"podgorica-montenegro"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 May 2020, shows Podgorica the capital and largest city of Montenegro. Podgorica is located in the Zeta plain. The main agricultural products in the area are wheat, potatoes and tobacco. In addition to agriculture, tourism is one of the most important industries for the nation's economy. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Montenegro suffered important losses in economic and human terms. Nevertheless, on 25 May 2020, the national government declared Montenegro to be the first COVID-19-free country in continental Europe and reopened the borders to tourists on 1 June. Data obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites were useful for monitoring some of the environmental impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite highlighted a decrease in the atmospheric concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) during the lockdown period in many areas of the world."
"point-lay-alaska-faces-consequences-climate-change"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 June 2023, shows the coastal town of Point Lay in Alaska, USA. The permafrost on the Arctic coast of Alaska is thawing so fast that it is destroying buildings and infrastructure in Point Lay. The soil here is largely made up of a mixture of organic material, sediment, and water in the form of ice. It's not like the solid, rocky ground that one might be familiar with in warmer climates. This frozen water acts as a sort of glue, keeping the soil stable and firm. When the ice within the permafrost melts due to rising temperatures, the soil loses this 'glue', transforming from a solid state to a more liquid state. As this happens, the thawing permafrost becomes less able to support structures built upon it. The buildings and infrastructure in Point Lay are built on this permafrost. As it thaws, the once solid ground starts to sink and shift, a process known as 'subsidence'. This leads to a steady lowering of the ground surface, causing damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Due to the severe permafrost degradation, the community is contemplating relocation to grant the survival of the village and have already declared a climate emergency to raise awareness. Data from the Copernicus satellites allow for an accurate and frequent monitoring of the consequences of climate change in the Arctic regions."
"poland-vistula-delta"	"This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 6 November 2022, shows the Vistula Delta, where the Vistula River, the largest river in Poland, which flows into the Baltic Sea. The area has been largely reclaimed from the sea thanks to a system of pumps and dikes, forming a wet and flat agricultural plain that has always been subject to flooding."
"polar-bears-forced-feed-landfill-northern-canada"	"Churchill is a town in northern Manitoba, Canada, situated on the western shores of Hudson Bay, at the edge of the Arctic. This human settlement has been increasingly visited by starving polar bears in search of food. In fact, because of climate change and the melting of sea ice, there has been a significant decline in the number of seals present in Hudson Bay. This is an issue for polar bears, who feed off the fat present in a seal's body. Due to this food shortage, more and more of them are now forced to approach the town’s landfill in search of subsistence. The town of Churchill and the Hudson Bay are visible in this image, which was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 2 October 2022. Data from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used operationally to monitor the impact of climate change on the fragile ecosystems of the Arctic."
"pollution-nitrogen-oxides-and-ozone-threatens-pollinators"	"This display shows the average value of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured between 1 and 31 December 2021 in the Po Valley (Northern Italy). The Po Valley is an area known for its high concentrations of this dangerous pollutant. According to a new study published in the scientific journal Environmental Pollution, air pollution from NOx and O3 makes it more difficult for pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, to find plants to feed off of their pollen and transport it as they move from spot to spot. The study, conducted on mustard plants, showed that high levels of nitrogen oxides and ozone led to a 70% drop in the number of bees and butterflies visiting them. The decrease in the number of pollinators implies potentially serious consequences for biodiversity as it could lead to the disappearance of thousands of plant species. The data provided by the Copernicus satellites and Services help us to assess the implementation of European policies, including those concerning air pollution and the protection of crucial biodiversity sites."
"polynya-arctic-ocean-may-2020"	"The thickest layer of sea ice in the northern hemisphere has historically been observed in the Arctic Ocean north of Ellesmere Island, Canada. This image of the same area north of Ellesmere Island, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite on 20 May 2020, shows the presence of an unusual stretch of open water – in this case larger than Luxembourg – known as a polynya. According to a new study published in the Geophysical Research Letters scientific journal, it was the first polynya ever observed at that time of year in the satellite era. According to the scientists that led the study, this phenomenon is another sign of rapid changes taking place in the Arctic region due to climate change. Climate change is affecting the Arctic more intensely than any other region, but the effects might also have a devastating impact on the entire northern hemisphere. The European Union has recently published a new strategy for the protection of the Arctic, aimed at tackling the impact of climate change on this fragile environment. More information regarding the new EU Arctic Strategy is available here."
"port-congestion-north-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 11 June 2022, shows 21 ships anchored off the Heligoland Archipelago waiting to dock in German ports, forming a ship “jam”. In recent months, global port congestion is responsible for important delays in container shipping, thus impacting international trade and the global supply chain. This is now also affecting the ports of the North Sea, where ships cannot be loaded nor unloaded. According to media reports, almost 2 per cent of global cargo capacity is currently stuck off the ports of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The combined use of radar and optical data acquired by Copernicus satellites provides useful information that can be applied to maritime surveillance activities around the world."
"portugal-faro"	"Faro is one of the most popular cities in Portugal. It is rich with historically and culturally significant features, and is one of the sunniest places in Europe. It is also the capital of the Algarve region in the south of the country. The Ria Formosa Natural Park, a collection of islands, sandbanks and lagoons along the coast of Faro, with rich and shallow waters, is an excellent spot for snorkelling, as seahorses often abound in these waters. This Copernicus Sentinel-2 image was acquired on 26 September 2022."
"positive-thermal-anomalies-north-antarctic-peninsula"	"This rare cloudless image of the northernmost part of the Antarctic Peninsula was acquired on 15 November 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites. This area, according to data from the Chilean Meteorological Institute, recorded temperatures well above the reference values for the period. In particular, on King George Island, located only 150 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula, the average temperature reached ~0°C about a month sooner than normal. Every month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) publishes a Climate Bulletin which details the current status of the climate, including a detailed overview of the temperature in Antarctica."
"presena-glacier"	"Each summer since 2008, the Presena glacier in northern Italy is protected by conservationists with geothermal, reflective tarps covering an area of approximately 100 km2. This operation aims to minimise the amount of snow that melts during the summer months and preserve the glacier lying beneath. Protecting the glacier from global warming is of utmost importance as it has lost more than one third of its volume in the last 27 years. At the end of summer, the tarps are removed and the area is once again exposed. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 July 2020, shows, in false colours (pink), the tarps that cover the glacier. Snow cover is an important driver of many ecological, climatic and hydrological processes in mountain regions and in high latitude areas. Data captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are particularly suitable for monitoring and mapping snow cover. This in turn provides indicators for us to better understand and implement data-driven methods to prevent the impacts of climate change."
"quarantine-camp-outside-shijiazhuang-china"	"2020 was a year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. More than two million deaths around the world were recorded. According to official news, China has largely brought the virus under control but a sudden rise in infections in the province of Hebei which surrounds Beijing has prompted mass testing, strict lockdowns and the moving of entire villages into quarantine facilities to avoid a resurgence of the pandemic. According to media, a massive quarantine camp that can hold 4,160 people has been built just outside Shijiazhuang, the capital of the Hebei province. The camp is meant to house close contacts of coronavirus patients as authorities carry out its contact tracing and testing programme. Work on the facility began on 13 January and the first section of the camp is complete and ready for use, while construction on a second phase is ongoing. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites on 12, 17 and 22 January 2021, show the three different construction stages of the quarantine camp outside Shijiazhuang. With a revisit time of 5 days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor rapid land changes around the world."
"rain-may-prevail-over-snow-arctic-end-century"	"The Arctic is rapidly changing due to climate change. Whilst climate change has had many consequences, one of the effects most highlighted by scientists is the rapid loss of sea ice. According to a recent study in the Nature Communications scientific journal, rain could start to prevail over snow in the region by the end of the century. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 8 August 2021, shows the north of the Scandinavian peninsula and the Norwegian Sea, one of the areas that could be most affected by this change. Data from Copernicus satellites are a vital resource for expanding our knowledge about climate change."
"ramli-agricultural-system-tunisia-threatened-climate-change"	"This image, acquired on 20 October 2021, shows the coastal wetlands of Ghar El Melh in Tunisia. Ghar El Melh is home to the Ramli agricultural system. This system, invented in the 17th century, uses a delicate balance of fresh water and salt water to sustain crops. The Ramli system has also been designated as a World Agricultural Heritage Site by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. However, the area is severely threatened by climate change. In recent years, extreme heat waves, as well as a sea level rise of only a few millimetres, have been enough to cause a significant reduction in the yields of harvests and put the entire system at risk of failing. Data from Copernicus satellites allow the effects of climate change to be monitored in ecotone (transition between ecosystems) areas, such as coastal wetlands."
"rare-bloom-atacama-desert-chile"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 13 October 2021, shows a rare bloom in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The Atacama Desert is one of the driest places on Earth. In some areas, such as the one shown in this image, rainfall of just a few millimetres occurs only every 4 to 5 years. This amount of water was sufficient to induce a rare flowering near the city of Caldera. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides high-resolution data that can be used to produce detailed maps of vegetation health and classification on a global scale."
"rare-cloud-free-view-mauritius"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 May 2021, shows a rare cloudless view of Mauritius. Mauritius is home to unique wildlife and biodiversity. It has been designated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as a 'Centre of Plant Diversity' and is included in the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar and Indian Ocean islands. Several of its habitats have experienced rapid destruction and fragmentation over the past four centuries due to the impact of human activities. More than 95% of the island's natural habitats have been destroyed or are threatened, making Mauritius one of the places with the highest extinction rates in the world. With a revisit time of 5 days on average at the equator, the open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites can be used to derive information to monitor the state of ecosystems around the world."
"rare-cloudless-image-faroe-islands"	"The Faroe Islands are an archipelago situated halfway between Iceland and Norway. Their remote location attracts high numbers of birds migrating over the North Atlantic Ocean: it is estimated that approximately 110 different species of birds can be found in the archipelago. The Atlantic Puffin is the second most numerous bird species in the Faroe Islands, and even though their population had started to diminish in recent years because of a reduction in fish stock close to the coast, it has now started to recover thanks to the new regulations put in place to preserve it. The Faroe Islands’ climate is influenced by cold currents coming from the Arctic Circle and mild currents coming from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in a nearly constant presence of clouds. However, on 27 March 2022, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this rare cloudless image, thanks to the extended high-pressure area that has characterised northern Europe and part of the Atlantic Ocean during the month of March 2022."
"rare-cloudless-image-south-coast-iceland-covered-snow"	"Iceland is located just south of the Arctic Circle. In the period from November to January, it therefore remains invisible to optical satellite acquisitions due to the boreal night. This image, dated 3 February, is the first 2022 image of Iceland to be acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. It shows a rare view of the southern part of the island entirely covered in snow. During this time of year, the island is usually hidden by clouds due to a continuous influx of Arctic storms."
"rare-cloudless-image-south-georgia"	"On 4 October 2021, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites acquired this rare cloud-free image of South Georgia in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Despite its proximity to Antarctica, South Georgia is a unique biodiversity hotspot, providing an ideal habitat for many species of seabirds and marine mammals. The entire maritime area around the islands has been protected since 2012 by one of the world's largest marine protected areas. In June 2021, the Government of South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands announced that it would also designate the island itself as a protected area to preserve it for future generations. Data from Copernicus missions and services are a powerful tool to support the monitoring of habitats that host biodiversity hotspots."
"rare-could-free-view-balkans-and-carpathian-mountains"	"On 17 October 2022, the high atmospheric pressure system persisting over central and western Europe made it possible for the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) instrument onboard one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites to capture a rare cloud-free view of the Balkans and of the Carpathian mountains. This high pressure system is causing an unseasonable heat wave that has caused temperature anomalies of around +12 degrees over central Europe. Copernicus data and services are useful for forest monitoring and management. For example, data released daily by the Sentinel satellites provides the opportunity to monitor the health of forests, while the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service delivers high-resolution geodata particularly suitable for forest management."
"rare-january-cyclone-northern-atlantic-ocean"	"On 16 January, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured this image, which shows a rare tropical cyclone that had formed in mid-January in the northern Atlantic Ocean. This is an unusual occurrence for this time of year, as the Atlantic hurricane season typically spans from June to November. The storm developed off the northeast coast of the United States and produced strong winds as it moved towards Nova Scotia before dissipating after making landfall in Canada. Data from Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites enable global monitoring of hurricanes and cyclones."
"recent-volcanic-activity-mexicos-popocatepetl-volcano"	"Popocatépetl is one of the most active volcanoes of Mexico. At the end of April 2023, its volcanic activity has increased, with frequent explosions and emissions of ash and toxic gases. The National Centre for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) have issued a yellow alert and advised people to stay away from the volcano. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 April 2023 at 17:18 UTC, shows an volcano's emission plume and hot spots in the crater. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites play an important role in volcanic activity monitoring thanks to the Short-Wave InfraRed channels of their Multispectral Instrument. The high spatial resolution and an average revisit time of five days allow them to monitor different volcanic processes and improve hot-spot detection techniques."
"recent-volcanic-activity-villarrica-chile"	"Villarrica is one of the most active volcanoes in Chile, known for its frequent strombolian activity and the occasional presence of a small lava lake in its summit crater. Over the past few days, moderate activity and frequent degassing have been observed at the volcano. The hot spot in the summit area of the Villarrica is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 March 2023. The twin Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) play an important role in monitoring volcanic activity: the high spatial and temporal resolution, as well as the multi-spectral capabilities of its imager, allows monitoring of different volcanic processes and enables hot spot detection."
"record-april-temperature-alert-canadian-arctic"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 30 April 2021, shows the Alert settlement in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. Alert is the northernmost permanently inhabited place in the world, located at latitude 82°30′ north, at slightly more than 800 kilometres from the North Pole. On the very day this image was acquired, a temperature of +2.4°C was recorded in the settlement. If officially confirmed, this high temperature is likely to become the all-time record for Alert in the month of April, as the current record stands at -0.2°C. With their maximal revisit time of five days, Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are an invaluable resource used to monitor the impact of climate change in important and sensitive environments such as the Arctic Circle."
"record-breaking-heatwave-causes-major-wildfires-canada"	"The ongoing extreme temperatures and record heatwave over western Canada have fuelled massive wildfires in British Columbia, such as the one visible in this image, which was imaged by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 July 2021 at Lytton. At the end of June Lytton, a town 200 km northeast of Vancouver, registered a record temperature of 49.6°C. On the same day a wildfire affected the area, forcing the immediate evacuation of the residents. As this Sentinel-2 image shows, on 1 July the fire was still active. The open data from the Copernicus missions allows to assess with great accuracy the effects of heatwaves on vegetation and to monitor wildifres globally ."
"record-heatwave-hit-canada-may-2023"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 13 May 2023, shows the town of Arviat, a small settlement located at the northern end of the Hudson Bay, close to the Arctic Circle, in the territory of Nunavut, Canada. On the same day the image was acquired, the area was hit by a record heat wave, making it the hottest day of May on record. In fact, Arviat recorded a temperature of +21.2°C, surpassing the previous record by over 6°C. Copernicus satellites and services provide open data that enable us to study the consequences of climate change around the world and develop mitigation and adaptation measures."
"record-heatwave-hit-spain-april-2023"	"In the last few days of April, a record heatwave hit Spain, with temperatures reaching the record temperature of 38.8°C at Córdoba airport. The intense heat has exacerbated an ongoing drought, leading to the drying up of several salt lakes in southern Spain that serve as habitats for migratory birds, such as flamingos. On 26 April, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imagery revealed that Fuente de Piedra, a famous lake in Andalusia known as a favourite stopover for flamingos, is completely dry. The use of Copernicus data enables scientists to monitor changes in ecosystems and biodiversity, helping us to better understand and protect our planet's natural resources."
"record-high-may-temperature-recorded-barcelona"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 May 2022, shows the city of Barcelona, on the northeastern coast of Spain. On the day of this image was acquired, the Barcelona Fabra Observatory recorded a temperature of 34.4ºC, the highest maximum May temperature since 1913, when weather measurements at this station started to be recorded. The previous record was set on May 31 2001, more than 20 years ago, with 33.4ºC. The record temperature was caused by the historical heatwave that hit western Europe before the onset of the meteorological summer, with many locations across Spain, France, Portugal and Germany setting new May records. The open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites enable us to develop a better understanding of the environmental phenomena linked to climate change."
"record-high-temperatures-arctic-circle"	"The intense heatwave gripping most of Europe in June 2022 has caused several temperature records to be broken. Even the Arctic Circle has been affected: temperatures in the far north of Norway reached the unprecedented value of 32°C. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 June, shows a massive sediment discharge into the Lyngenfjorden and Ullsfjorden fjords, caused by the heat-induced ice melt near Lyngseidet. The area is only a few kilometres away from the city of Tromsø, which reached a temperature of 29.9°C on 28 June 2022, just 0.3°C below its all-time record. Copernicus open data and services are key to the monitoring of the effects of climate change in fragile environments such as the Arctic regions."
"record-low-sea-ice-laptev-sea"	"The Laptev Sea is the main nursery for sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. In the summer of 2020, severe heat waves affected the area. As a result, the sea ice along the Siberian coast melted more rapidly than usual, resulting in large open areas of ice-free waters. The direct sunshine warmed up these arctic open waters to more than 5 degrees Celsius above average: due to the enormous amount of heat accumulated and to the windy conditions that were inhibiting water refreezing, at the end of October 2020 the sea ice in the Laptev Sea reached an absolute minimum vis-á-vis the lowest extension on records. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 24 October 2020, shows the status of the sea ice in one of the areas in the Laptev Sea in which the minimum extension of sea ice can be observed. RADAR data obtained by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites are not influenced by the presence of clouds, or by polar seasonal long nights. They are therefore particularly useful for monitoring the sea ice in Polar Regions."
"record-low-sea-ice-laptev-sea-month-june"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 July, shows sea ice in the easternmost part of the Laptev Sea. Under normal conditions, the sea ice in this area is still compact at the beginning of July. However, the image shows that at the beginning of July 2021 the sea ice has almost completely melted away. According to EUMETSAT data, the area recorded the lowest sea ice extent for a month of June since 1980, the year in which the organisation started building its time series. Open data from Copernicus missions contribute to the monitoring of sea ice extent in polar regions."
"record-number-wildfires-amazonas-brazil"	"Brazil is currently affected by numerous fires burning down large portions of its territory. According to the National Institute for Space Research of Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, INPE), the number of active hotspots detected in July 2022 in Amazonas, northern Brazil, was the third highest recorded since 2006. Moreover, the numerous blazes are producing smoke plumes that are engulfing the skies of part of the country and affecting air quality. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 31 July 2022, shows active fires – and the emitted smoke – close to Apuí, a municipality located in eastern Amazonas. The open data retrieved by Copernicus Sentinel satellites are an important source of valuable information related to wildfire events. For example, they are key for detecting active fires and assessing the damages caused."
"record-number-winter-birds-ebro-delta-natural-park-spain"	"On 1 March 2022, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this image of the Ebro River delta in the autonomous region of Catalonia in Spain. The Ebro Delta is home to a unique biodiversity and the Natural Park in which it is located is thus protected as a RAMSAR and Natura 2000 site. According to the Natural Park authorities, during the 2021-2022 winter, 317,425 specimens belonging to as many as 96 different species have been recorded on site, the highest number of winter waterfowl ever recorded in the area. However, experts predict that the number of waterfowl will decrease in the near future as a consequence of the ongoing drought in the Iberian Peninsula."
"record-setting-heatwave-europe-february-2021"	"In the final week of February 2021, many European countries have recorded temperatures more than 12°C above historical average for this time period. On 24 February, record temperatures for February were measured in Germany, where Hamburg exceeded 20°C for the first time, and Berlin logged a high of 19.7°C. It was also unusually warm in Austria, with highs of up to 23°C. Bilje set a new national monthly record in Slovenia with 25.3°C, and Croatia reported a record high of 26.4°C in Knin. Records were also broken in France, with 22.7°C in Colmar and 21.5°C in Pontarlier, and Italy was not far behind with peaks of up to 24–25°C in several central-northern locations. These two images have been obtained using data retrieved by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission on 24 February 2021 ; they show a cloud-free view (left) and the land surface temperature (right) in central Europe. The complete absence of clouds allowed for a detailed look that, already at 9:44 UTC, revealed that the land surface temperature in large parts of Italy, Slovenia and Croatia was above 20°C, while it reached between 17°C and 20°C in France and Germany. The main objective of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is to measure sea surface topography using the SRAL instrument, sea and land surface temperature using the SLSTR instrument, and ocean and land surface colour using the OLCI instrument. These three instruments aboard the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite allow for accurate and reliable measurements that support ocean, environmental and climate monitoring."

"record-setting-temperatures-south-africa-april-2021"	"These images, produced using Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite data on 13 April 2021, show a cloud-free view (right) and the land surface temperature (left) in southern Namibia and north-western South Africa. As early as 8:15 UTC, the complete absence of clouds allowed for a detailed look that showed land surface temperature values above 45°C (i.e. the temperature of the soil itself, not the air at ground level) on the border between Namibia and South Africa. Experts indicate that the village of Vioolsdrif in South Africa may have recorded the highest minimal daily air temperature ever in April in the Southern Hemisphere, with a value of 31.7°C. An official confirmation of this record is still to come, as the local weather station has reported faulty measurements in the past. The twin Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are equipped with a Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument, which allow for the accurate monitoring of the land surface temperature around the globe."
"record-temperature-eureka-canada"	"During June 2020, numerous temperature records were broken in the Arctic Circle. Among the most significant were 38°C in Verhojansk (Lat. 67°5'North, Siberia) on 19 June and 21.4°C in the settlement of Eureka (Lat. 79°59'North, Canada) on 27 June. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 June 2020, shows Eureka, Ellesmere Island, Qikiqtaaluk Region, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. Eureka is inside the Arctic Circle and is one of the northernmost inhabited locations of the world. Copernicus Sentinel-2, with a maximum revisit time of five days, is very useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in such an important and delicate environment as the Arctic Circle."
"record-temperatures-greenland"	"A recent study published by the Nature journal has revealed that temperatures in Greenland have been higher in recent decades than in any other period in the past 1,000 years. The study analysed data from ice cores and reconstructed temperatures in Greenland going back to 1,000 AD. Results indicate that current temperatures are on average 1.5°C higher than pre-industrial levels. This warming is caused by the joint effect of natural local variability and anthropogenic climate change, caused by activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. The warming of Greenland's ice sheets can have serious consequences for global sea levels, as melting ice contributes to sea level rise. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 January 2023, is the first image of Greenland captured in 2023. The Copernicus Sentinels satellite missions play an important role in monitoring remote areas such as the Arctic."
"record-temperatures-madeira-portugal"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 June 2023, shows the island of Madeira. Part of a larger archipelago comprising four islands and designated as an autonomous Portuguese region, Madeira is located off the western Moroccan coast. The day this image was acquired was the hottest day in Madeira’s climatic history, as temperatures reached 38.7°C. The record was broken again the following day with temperatures of 39.1°C. Copernicus Open Data enable to develop a better understanding of the environmental phenomena linked to climate change."
"record-temperatures-spain"	"A severe heatwave is ongoing in the Mediterranean basin, and numerous air temperature records have been broken. After a record-breaking temperature of 48.8°C was recorded in Siracusa in Sicily (possibly the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe, as it needs to be confirmed by the WMO), it was Spain’s turn. This cloudless image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 13 August 2021, shows the location of some of the cities where record temperatures were registered, including Toledo with 44.2°C and Granada with 44.0°C. Numerous extreme events are attributable to climate change. Copernicus provides useful data, services and satellite missions to study them and monitor their effects."
"recovery-tonga-archipelago-after-volcanic-eruption"	"On 15 January 2022, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano erupted in the Tonga Archipelago. According to scientists from the University of Auckland, the eruption was the most powerful recorded on Earth in the past 30 years and it triggered a 1.2-metre-high tsunami that hit the coastal areas of Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa. The disaster heavily impacted the local population, the environment, and the economy: communities, roads, and airports were covered by thick ash, and floodwaters damaged infrastructure, homes and schools. Power and communication channels were disrupted for days, with internet connection being restored only 5 weeks after the eruption. The World Bank has estimated the total bill for the damage to be above €80 million, which is equivalent to more than 18% of the gross domestic product of the small Kingdom of Tonga. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), one of the consequences of the Tonga eruption was the significant damage that the island’s vegetation and crops have suffered, mainly as a result of the ashfall. However, three months after the eruption, the vegetation on the Nomuka, Nomuka Iki and Mango Islands is starting to recover as shown in these images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 January 2022 (left) and 14 April 2022 (right), three months apart. Data retrieved from Copernicus Satellites and the Copernicus Services help assess the aftermath of natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis, supporting emergency response and recovery activities."
"reforestation-costa-rica"	"For years, Costa Rica struggled with the devastating consequences of deforestation. The natural landscape was heavily threatened, and the nation's rich biodiversity was at risk. However, over the past 15 years, Costa Rica has taken massive steps in land restoration, successfully increasing its forest cover from a mere 25% to an impressive 57%. This remarkable transformation was the result of multiple efforts to revitalise the nation's precious ecosystems. On 18 April, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Preserve, one of the areas positively impacted by the successful reforestation process. The Copernicus satellites enable continuous monitoring of forests, providing invaluable data for tracking and managing their health and growth."
"renaissance-pantanal-wetlands-brazil"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 May 2021, shows the Pantanal wetlands in Brazil. In 2020, a fire season of unprecedented intensity led to an ecological disaster in the Pantanal. However, this year the ecosystem appears to be regenerating. According to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), the total number of fires in this area has decreased by 88% in the first months of 2021, as compared to the same period of 2020. The immediate consequence of the significant decrease is the accelerated recovery of the lush landscape of the Pantanal, as shown in this Sentinel-2 image. Despite the apparent outlook, researchers warn that the frequency and magnitude of fires recorded in the past several years threatens to compromise the balance of the entire ecosystem. Thanks to their high frequency of acquisition, data provided by Sentinel-2 satellites is a source of valuable information that can be used to study fragile biodiversity in regions at risk such as the Pantanal."
"renewable-energy-solutions-qaanaaq-greenland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 June 2022, shows Qaanaaq, the northernmost town in Greenland, standing about 1,400 kilometres south of the North Pole. Local authorities and researchers from the Dartmouth College are developing systems that exploit renewable energy even in the extreme climatic conditions typical of northern isolated communities such as Qaanaaq, which remain largely dependent on fossil fuels. Among the many data sets and products provided by Copernicus, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) supports the renewable energy sector by providing input (wind, solar and hydro) and energy forecasts (capacity factors, demand, volatility) at regional and national scale in Europe."
"restoration-peatlands-slowinski-national-park-poland"	"Peatlands, in their natural state, are one of the best carbon-storing ecosystems, as they are capable of permanently binding carbon to the soil. However, when peats are degraded, they become a major source of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere, contributing to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aim of the LIFE Peat Restore project is therefore to mitigate climate change by means of restoring peatlands in Northern Europe. One of the restored sites, the Słowiński National Park on the Baltic coast of Poland, is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 23 May 2022. Previously degraded as a consequence of draining and deforestation, the Słowiński National Park peatlands are being restored in order to recover their nominal ecosystem conditions, restoring biodiversity and contributing to carbon storage and to water retention and purification. Some of the measures implemented include the prohibition of artificial ditches at more than 200 locations, as well as the improved conservation of existing vegetation. Sensors onboard the Copernicus Sentinel satellites supply crucial data for studying and monitoring the impact of climate change on fragile and essential ecosystems such as peatlands around the globe."
"restored-habitats-bulgarias-lake-atanasovsko"	"The Atanasovsko Lake, shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 June 2022, is part of the Burgas lakes complex, one of the three most significant wetlands for congregations of waterfowl along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. It is home to unique biodiversity and became a Natura2000 site in 2006. A disastrous flood which happened in 2010 destroyed water management facilities in the Atanasovsko Lake area, changing its hydrological and hydro-chemical conditions and disrupting the local environment. The Salt of Life Project, started in 2012, successfully contributed to the restoration of a satisfactory conservation status of the coastal lagoon habitat of the Atanasovsko Lake, for the benefit of the targeted bird species who have now repopulated the area. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and thematic services make it possible to extract vital information on the state of implementation of European policies, including those relating to the monitoring of water quality and the protection of critical biodiversity sites."
"retreat-bangladeshs-mangroves"	"This image, acquired on 27 December 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows an area of the Sundarbans Reserve Forest in Bangladesh, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. Mangroves are one of the most biologically important ecosystems on the planet. In addition to their vital contribution to biodiversity, they also protect coastal communities from storm surges. However, the increasing number of extreme weather events – a by-product of climate change – is reducing their extent. According to the World Meteorological Organisation's ""The State of the Climate in Asia 2020"" report, the extent of mangroves in Bangladesh, such as those shown in this Sentinel-2 image, decreased by 19% between 1992 and 2019 because of the multiple tropical storms that impacted the area. Copernicus Sentinel missions are a valuable asset for mapping and monitoring the extent of mangroves on a global scale."
"retreat-italys-largest-glacier"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 August 2021, shows the Adamello glacier in the Alps. Adamello is the largest glacier in Italy. According to the latest surveys performed, the current extent of the glacier is about 14 square kilometres. Official estimates calculate that around 4 square kilometres of the glacier (an area equal to that of 570 football pitches) have been lost in the last 33 years as a consequence of global warming. In addition, official data indicate that the glacier has lost about 65 metres in thickness, including 5.9 metres in 2021. The loss in thickness now stands at an average of 4.5 metres per year. Data from Copernicus satellites are used to monitor the retreat of glaciers around the world."
"retreat-khumbu-glacier-causes-relocation-mt-everest-base-camp"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 June, shows Mt. Everest in the Himalayas Mountains. Mt. Everest, despite being the highest mountain on earth, is not spared from the impact of climate change. The Khumbu Glacier, located along the western flank of the mountain, is undergoing rapid retreat due to rising global temperatures. The retreat is so pronounced that the Everest Base Camp, located on its edge, will soon be moved to a lower latitude. Snow cover and glaciers are an important driver of many climatic processes worldwide: both snow and glaciers can be monitored and mapped using the Copernicus Sentinel satellites."
"retreating-neumayer-glacier-south-georgia"	"The Neumayer Glacier is one of the largest tidewater glaciers in South Georgia. This glacier is very sensitive to climate change: flowing into the sea, even a small warming of the ocean's temperature can accelerate its retreat. According to Mauri Pelto, Director of the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project, the Neumayer Glacier has been experiencing a retreat rate of over ~420 m/year in recent years. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 January 2021, shows the current status of the Neumayer Glacier. Comparing the glacier terminus as seen in the latest Sentinel-2 image (line in magenta) with a Landsat-8 image acquired in April 2005 (line in cyan) shows that the glacier has shrunk by more than 8 km in 16 years. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to detect and monitor glaciers globally."
"rhine-meuse-scheldt-delta-will-be-heavily-impacted-climate-change"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 March 2022, shows the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt (RMS) delta on the west coast of the Netherlands. The RMS is the largest delta in Europe, consisting of a complex system of distributaries and islands formed by the confluence of the Rhine, the Meuse and the Scheldt rivers. Many of these islands are below sea level, making the entire area particularly vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise. The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service has recently released a Coastal Zones dataset, a new product developed to monitor the complex dynamics of coastal environments and to support concrete actions to mitigate the effects of climate change, particularly of sea level rise."
"rhodes"	"This image, acquired by one of Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 11 October 2020, shows Rhodes, the largest island in the Greek Dodecanese chain in the southeastern Aegean Sea. Humans have lived on the island since the stone age. In the Classical period the famous Colossus, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was built on the island. In the Middle Ages, Rhodes saw extraordinary architectural developments and its medieval historic centre, still perfectly preserved today, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988. From a naturalistic point of view, a great variety of vegetation thrives on the island and many species of migratory birds use it as a resting place. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are useful for monitoring cultural heritage treasures around the world."
"ria-formosa-coastal-lagoon-portugal"	"This image, acquired on 20 November by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon.

It is a dynamic system constantly changing with the continuous movement of winds, currents and tides. Ria Formosa is also a mecca for birdwatchers and considered one of the most important habitats for aquatic birds in Portugal, hosting about 20.000 birds during the winter. With a revisit time of 5 days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor the status of ecosystems around the world."
"rio-de-la-plata-estuary"	"The Rio de la Plata estuary is one of the largest ones in the world. A constant mixing of freshwater and seawater in this area is visible from space, as shown in the image captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 14 February 2022. The Rio de la Plata estuary drains the waters of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, which flow through five South American countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia). Along their course, the two rivers drain large quantities of sediments, which are then discharged into the estuary together with freshwater. Beautiful eddies are created by the mixing of the freshwater with the saltwater, together with the sediments, floating near the surface and appearing in shades of brown. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, which allow us to monitor water quality and sediment transport in coastal areas."
"rising-sea-levels-hit-fiji"	"Fiji, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, is facing a grave threat from climate change. Rising sea levels are affecting several coastal villages, with predictions that more than 600 communities could be forced to relocate in the coming years. This Copernicus Sentinel-2 image, acquired on the 19 of December 2022, shows the southern part of Viti Levu island, one of the areas most affected by the rising sea levels. The Copernicus Sentinel-6A satellite provides crucial data for monitoring sea level rise, by measuring the height of the ocean surface with high accuracy and precision, it allows to track the changes over time and understand the causes of sea level rise, such as the ocean’s thermal expansion and ice melting, as well as to improve weather forecasting and ocean circulation models."
"rising-sea-temperatures-threaten-tiger-shark-populations"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 January, shows the Exuma archipelago in the Bahamas. The Exuma Sea is an important habitat for tiger sharks. According to a recent study published in the Global Change Biology scientific journal, tiger sharks are changing the routes by which they travel to arrive at reproductive sites due to rising sea temperatures. Specifically, sharks are moving out of their usual marine environment in search of cooler temperatures during the breeding season. However, finding themselves in unusual ecosystems, to which they are less-well adapted, could put their survival at risk. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide over 16 terabytes of open data everyday which contribute to monitoring the state of biodiversity around the world."
"rising-temperatures-corsica"	"This image of Corsica was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 11 January 2022. Corsica is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean. Because of its geographical location, the island is particularly affected by the challenges stemming from climate change. However, Corsica is also actively addressing them, for instance by evaluating and preparing mitigation and adaptation measures to the threats to its coastal and marine ecosystems as a consequence of rising sea levels. The island is located in one of the areas where the predicted increase of both air temperatures and evapotranspiration (the sum of evaporation from the land surface plus transpiration from plants), as well as decreasing precipitation and soil moisture, will be highly pronounced. According to the French Meteorological Agency Météo France, the temperature increase is already measurable. In 2021, Corsica’s average air temperature was 0.6°C higher than the reference value. Copernicus satellites provide important data for monitoring the effects of climate change around the world."
"rixensart-and-lasne-belgium-blanketed-snow"	"In the aftermath of Storm Darcy that hit Europe in the second week of February 2021, regions that rarely experience heavy snowfall have been blanketed in snow. The storm, which originated in Russia, has affected Northern European countries the most, causing major disruptions in daily life. The Netherlands has experienced its first large snowstorm in the past ten years, with disrupted air and rail traffic, and disruptions due to the snow were also recorded throughout the entire rail and road traffic network in Germany. In Brussels, the three largest train stations are temporarily being kept open for 24 hours a day to shelter the homeless from the snow and freezing temperatures. Storm Darcy is the latest extreme weather phenomenon in a particularly cold winter in Northern Europe. According to a report published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service on 9 February, the entire month of January 2021 was colder than average. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 February 2021, shows Rixensart and Lasne covered with snow.

Recently, a webinar was held on how Copernicus contributes to the monitoring of the polar regions. Additional details are available here."
"sahara-dust-over-atlantic-ocean"	"A vast cloud of Sahara dust, nicknamed “Godzilla cloud”, has covered the Atlantic Ocean. Beginning on the coasts of Mauritania, dust travelled to the Caribbean and parts of the United States, with concentration levels that had not been seen, or recorded, in half a century. This image, derived from the data acquired by the Tropomi instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite on 23 June 2020, shows the dust cloud covering the Atlantic Ocean across a distance greater than 7000 km. With a revisit time of one day, the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite delivers free and open access data that can be used to monitor air quality worldwide, and this data can inform models that predict the impact of dust storms."
"saharan-dust-over-mediterranean-sea"	"This image of a Saharan dust cloud above the Mediterranean Sea was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 21 March 2021. This Saharan dust cloud that stretches over a length of 800 kilometres has been travelling across the Mediterranean Sea, from the coast of Libya and towards Greece and the Southern Balkans. In February 2021, a massive Saharan dust episode had already painted sunsets in continental Europe in eerie orange, leaving snow in the Pyrénées and the Alps covered with sand. Sandstorms and dust clouds such as this one can affect the quality of the air we breathe. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) monitors and forecasts air quality on a global scale by assessing the concentration and modelling the transport and dispersion of air pollutants."
"saharan-dust-over-southern-italy"	"This image of a Saharan dust cloud covering Sardinia and the central part of the Tyrrhenian Sea was acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 15 September 2021. This Saharan dust cloud, that at the time of image acquisition was covering an area of about 40,000 km2, is travelling across the Mediterranean Sea, from the coast of Tunisia towards southern Italy. According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecast, this Saharan dust episode will last for several days and will affect Greece over the weekend. Saharan dust clouds can impact the quality of the air we breathe.

"saharan-dust-plume-atlantic-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 5 June 2020, shows a Saharan dust plume extending about 800 km off the coast of Senegal. The dust plumes in this area are triggered by strong winds that blow across the Sahara Desert. These episodes can cause respiratory and visibility issues, but at the same time, they have a unique ecological value. They in fact support the biodiversity of Atlantic Ocean islands and Amazonian rainforests by transporting nutrients and substrates needed to sustain these ecosystems. Data from Copernicus missions and services can be used to monitor air quality around the world."
"saharan-dust-plume-mediterranean-basin"	"In early April 2023, multiple plumes of Saharan dust were observed originating from Africa. On 4 April, Copernicus Sentinel-3 captured an image of a large plume stretching hundreds of kilometres from the coast of Libya to Türkiye. These dust plumes can have severe impacts on the environment, air quality, and human health. Therefore, monitoring them is crucial for protecting human health and the environment. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service provides essential information on the movement and behaviour of these Saharan dust plumes, enabling authorities to take preventive measures to minimise their impact."

"saharan-dust-storm-atlantic-ocean"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 14 February 2023, shows a Saharan dust storm with transport from the west coast of Africa over to the Atlantic Ocean. The air quality in the Canary Islands (Spain) has been affected by the high concentration of particulate matter (dust) in the air. This has resulted in a yellow alert issued by the Spanish National Meteorological Agency (AEMET). The dust has also caused reduced visibility and disrupted air traffic. According to the forecast by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, the dust had reached Ireland by the night of 14 February and is expected to reach the Arctic Circle in the coming days."
"saharan-dust-storm-likely-reach-brazil"	"A new Saharan Dust storm, the fourth one since the beginning of 2022, is ongoing in the Atlantic Ocean. On 3 March 2022, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured the dust cloud extending from the coast of Senegal to Cabo Verde, as shown in this image. According to the aerosol forecasts of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, the dust could travel all the way to Brazil in the next few days."
"saharan-dust-storm-over-atlantic-ocean-january-2022"	"These images, produced using data acquired on 18 January 2022 by Copernicus satellites, show a massive Saharan dust storm billowing out over the Atlantic Ocean. As shown in the left image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, the 4,000 km-long dust plume extends from the coast of Mauritania to the shores of Ireland. The right image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite, shows a detail of the plume as it was hovering south of the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands.

It has painted the snow in the Pyrénées mountain range (and also in the Alps) in brownish colours and turned the skies orange . This episode had been forecasted by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Such events have been documented in the scientific literature. For example, a 2019 study entitled, “Saharan dust events in the European Alps: role in snowmelt and geochemical characterization” was published in The Cryosphere. The paper concluded that Saharan dust reduces snow cover duration in Europe. Through a process called the snow-albedo feedback, dust darkens snow making it less reflective, which leads to increased snowmelt over time. These dust episodes also represent a major environmental and health hazard. This true colours image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 February 2021, shows dust covered snow in the Ariège Pyrénées Regional Natural Park in southeast France.

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service is monitoring the consequences of the wildfires. More details are available here."
"salar-de-atacama-chile"	"The Atacama Desert in Chile is on the driest place on Earth. Within this arid environment lies a salt flat, or playa, named Salar de Atacama. With an extension of about 3000 km2, the Salar de Atacama is the largest salt flat of Chile and one of the largest active sources of lithium of the world. Lithium is used for the manufacturing of batteries, and the increasing demand has significantly increased its value in recent years – especially for the production of electric-car batteries. It is extracted by a complex process, at the end of which it is dried in large open-air ponds. In this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 November 2020, the evaporation ponds in which lithium is isolated are highlighted in red tones. With a revisit time of five days on average at the equator, the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor environmental phenomena."

"san-quintin-glacier-chile"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 March 2021, shows the terminal part of the San Quintín Glacier in Chile, which has been in rapid retreat for the past 30 years due to the effects of climate change. The San Quintín Glacier is located in the Laguna San Rafael National Park, which hosts the second largest contiguous ice sheet outside polar regions. Until 1991 it advanced over the surrounding vegetation-covered land, but it has since begun to retreat and melt, forming a proglacial lake at its terminus. According to Mauri Pelto, Professor of Environmental Science at Nichols College in Massachusetts, the San Quintín Glacier Lake may be the fastest growing lake of the 21st century in South America. Meltwater from retreating glaciers such as the San Quintín Glacier contributes to rising sea levels. In 2020, the Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite was launched into orbit with the mission of accurately measuring the height of the sea surface until at least 2030. The open data it delivers will improve our knowledge and understanding of the sea level rise as a consequence of climate change."
"sand-and-dust-transported-windstorm-iceland"	"In recent weeks, Iceland has been hit by a series of storms. On 7 July 2022, the Icelandic Meteorological Office issued a yellow weather alert because of strong winds and considerable rainfall affecting most of the country. A recent windstorm has transported sand and dust, which have coloured brown part of the Vatnajökull National Park ice cap, as visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 13 July. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides aerosol forecasts useful for monitoring dust transport during windstorms."
"santorini-island"	"Restrictions on travel, introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, are slowly being eased, allowing tourism to restart in a growing number of destinations. The latest research by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) shows that many destinations worldwide have reopened, with Europe leading the way. In Santorini, the most visited island of Greece, hoteliers expect occupancy to reach only 15% of the levels from recent years. Few if none of the cruise ships that normally moor in the bay of Santorini are expected this year. This visualisation compares images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 July 2019 and 11 July 2020 over the bay of Santorini. The complete absence of ships is evident in the image on the right (2020).

"sao-miguel-island-portugal"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 July 2021, shows São Miguel Island in Portugal’s Azores archipelago. São Miguel is home to an autochthonous temperate mixed forest that hosts many habitats and remarkable biodiversity. This forest, like many other forests in the world, is under increasing pressure from climate change, fragmentation due to land use changes, etc. As part of the EU Green Deal, the European Commission will publish a new forestry strategy in 2021 that will form the basis of an innovative approach to forest management and protection. Open data from the Copernicus programme are particularly useful for forest monitoring and management. For example, the data released daily by the Sentinel satellites provide the opportunity to monitor the health of forests, while the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service data supplies high-resolution data particularly suited for forest management."
"sargassum-caribbean-sea"	"The Caribbean Sea is affected by massive amounts of toxic algae that are causing serious damage to the tourism industry, and to biodiversity. On 1 August, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured banks of these algae, named sargassum, floating off Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados."
"sargassum-dominican-republic-coast"	"The Dominican Republic is a nation located on the island of Hispaniola, in the archipelago of the Caribbean region. It boasts the most diverse array of wetlands in the Caribbean, including the region’s largest salt lake and the largest freshwater lake. During the last summers, a large quantity of brown algae - known as sargassum - has poured on the coasts of the Caribbean Sea. These algae constitute an important habitat for many species, however when accumulated along the coasts, they rot and produce an unpleasant odour, causing serious problems both for the environment and for the tourism industry. This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 8 May 2020, has been processed in such a way that highlights the vegetation (and therefore also the algae) with a bright red colour. Data obtained by Copernicus Satellites help local services and organisations monitor the sargassum blooms in the sea and help predict when algae are approaching the coast."
"savage-islands-portugal"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 October 2021, shows the Savage Islands, an archipelago under Portuguese jurisdiction located halfway between Madeira and the Canary Islands. The archipelago, according to naturalists, represents the most intact ecosystem in the north-east Atlantic. Due to the unique nature of this ecosystem, at the end of November 2021, the Portuguese government declared the Savage Islands a protected marine area. As such, it is the largest in an EU country and in the entire North Atlantic. With a revisit time of 5 days on average at the equator, the open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites can be used to derive information to monitor the state of land and marine ecosystems around the world."

"sea-greenhouses-almeria"	"In the 1970s, Almería was still a small and rural agricultural area of southern Spain. In 40 years, an area of around 20,000 hectares has been transformed into a giant greenhouse, producing millions of tons of vegetables for export to both Europe and the rest of the world. The number and volume of greenhouses are so high that they are clearly visible from space, giving the area its nickname: ""the sea of greenhouses."" This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 27 June 2020, shows the sea of greenhouses surrounding El Ejido, a small town in the south east of Almería. With its 13 spectral bands, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission can capture images with wavelengths both from the visible and the thermal infrared spectrum (which is not visible to the human eye) at a high spatial resolution of 10 to 60 metres. These capabilities make the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites suitable for the mapping and monitoring of the ever-changing surface of our planet."
"sea-ice-bering-sea"	"Summertime Arctic sea ice loss has made headlines, but winter ice in the region has also shown recent signs of decline. A new study published in Science Advances shows that both in February 2018 and February 2019, the extent of sea ice in the Bering Sea (a sea between Siberia and Alaska) was 60 to 70 percent lower than the average 1979 to 2017 February-to-May extent and that this minimum is caused by climate change. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, shows the status of the Bering Sea on 24 February 2019, during the sea ice maximum extension period. Copernicus satellite data is key for monitoring the impact of Climate Change on Arctic sea ice extent."
"sea-ice-break-antarctic-peninsula"	"The Larsen Ice Shelf is a large glacial shelf extending along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Researchers studying Antarctica divide this area into four: Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B, Larsen C (the largest), and Larsen D. A large sheet of sea ice has coalesced on the eastern coast of the Larsen B over the past 10 years. However, January 2022 saw a breakup of the sea ice. The cause was probably a boreal summer warmer than usual. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 January, shows the sea ice after it broke away from Larsen-B. Every month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) publishes a Climate Bulletin that details the current status of the climate, including a detailed overview of the temperatures in Antarctica."
"sea-ice-coloured-green-ross-sea"	"February marks the peak of summer in Antarctica, providing the opportunity to observe unusual phenomena affecting the continent's ice. On 16 February, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured a rare image of green-tinged sea ice due to a phytoplankton bloom in the Ross Sea. In 2017, the same phenomenon of green ice was observed in the same region, and according to scientists from Australia's Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre, the green colour was caused by phytoplankton at the water's surface, which had discoloured the sea ice. Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites allow the monitoring of polar regions and enable scientists to gain a better understanding of how their environment is evolving as a result of climate change."
"sea-ice-eastern-coast-greenland"	"Sea ice is of capital importance in climate dynamics as it reflects most of the solar radiation that it receives, thus affecting the average albedo of the earth, and also because it interposes a solid layer between the ocean and the atmosphere which reduces the free transfer of heat and moisture between the two. In 2020 Arctic sea ice has reached the second-lowest area in 42 years, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, a trend that experts believe is showing how climate change is impacting this vulnerable ecosystem and those who rely on sea ice for their livelihood. As sea ice is less dense than water, it floats on the ocean's surface and can help trace the underlying ocean currents, which result in typical swirls or eddies visible from satellites. This true colour image has been captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 on 25 September and shows numerous sea ice swirls along the eastern coast of Greenland. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission, that consists of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B), allows to develop innovative applications for sea ice monitoring, thanks to the onboard instruments that are able to retrieve accurate information about sea ice extent, temperature and thickness."
"sea-ice-extent-anomaly-barents-sea-arctic-ocean"	"This mosaic, composed from nine images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 21 April 2021, provides evidence of the anomalous absence of sea ice in the Barents Sea. According to data published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service in March 2021, the Arctic sea ice extent was the 8th lowest ever recorded by satellite (since 1979) for the month of March. A notable exception to this was observed in the southeastern Barents Sea, where a positive anomaly with a higher sea ice concentration than the 1981–2010 average was recorded. The mosaic shows that the sea ice in the southeastern Barents Sea had already melted only a few days after the release of the Copernicus Climate Change Service sea ice report, as a consequence of high insolation caused by a high pressure system over the area. Open data provided by Copernicus products and services allow for the development of authoritative assessments of the state of sea ice coverage worldwide."
"sea-ice-foxe-basin-nunavut-canada"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 August 2020, shows the sea ice extension in the Foxe Basin in Nunavut, Canada. Foxe Basin is a shallow oceanic basin north of Hudson Bay, located east of Baffin Island. For most of the year, it is covered with sea ice and drift ice made up of multiple ice floes. The nutrient-rich cold waters found in the basin are known to be particularly favourable to the development of phytoplankton while the numerous islands in the basin are important bird habitats. The twin Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, with their 5 days revisit period, help to monitor and study the sea ice extension and its dynamic transport in oceanic waters."
"sea-ice-shore-alaska-coast"	"Each year, from the end of March to the beginning of April, strong continental winds blow over the west coast of Alaska. They cause the sea ice, which is loosened already by the increased sunshine in spring, to break up and drift off the coast, carried by the winds. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 March 2022, shows the sea ice drifting away from the coast off Utqiaġvik, one of the northernmost towns in Alaska."
"sea-ice-shore-utqiagvik-alaska"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 April 2021, shows the city of Utqiaġvik in Alaska, the northernmost settlement of the United States. Utqiaġvik, which is located north of the Arctic Circle, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In addition to the melting of the thick layer of permafrost on which the city's structures have been built, the local community struggles with the consequences of an increase in coastal erosion caused by the absence of the summer sea ice that used to protect the coast from storms originating in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Sea. The twin Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, with a maximal revisit time of five days each, are useful for the monitoring of the impact of climate change in important and sensitive environments such as the Arctic Circle."
"sea-ice-swirls"	"At the end of the winter, sea ice in the Arctic starts melting and swirling. The mesmerising shapes are formed as the sea ice, suspended in the highly salted sea water, is transported along the dynamic currents. This image acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 20 April shows these melt dependent characteristic swirls off the eastern coast of Greenland. Copernicus satellite data is key for ensuring the safety of arctic shipping lanes and for monitoring the impact of Climate Change on Arctic sea ice extent"
"sea-ice-swirls-along-east-coast-greenland"	"According to data released by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the Arctic sea ice in February 2021 extended by 14.39 million square kilometres, which is its seventh smallest satellite-recorded area for February since measurements began in 1981. The maximal extension of the Arctic sea ice this winter occurred at the beginning of March. The extent and seasonal variation of sea ice are of fundamental importance in climate dynamics. In the Arctic, the sea ice extent grows from October and throughout the winter, reaching its maximum around March, after which it begins to melt until it reaches its minimum in September. However, the aggregated sea ice does not remain within the Arctic Circle. Due to the Earth’s rotation and the East Greenland Current, the sea ice that forms east of Greenland flows southward away from the Arctic Ocean and along the island’s eastern coast, into the Atlantic. As it travels, it often forms impressive swirls, as the ones visible in this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image acquired on 11 March 2021. The twin Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites help to monitor and study the sea ice extension in polar regions and its dynamic transport in oceanic waters."
"sea-ice-uda-gulf-russia"	"This image shows the Uda Bay in the Khabarovsk Krai, in Russia. The Uda Gulf is located in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk, in the Siberian Pacific. The climate of the area is subarctic with mild and wet summers and very cold and dry winters. Windstorms typically affect sea ice in the gulf between November and mid-July allowing the formation of graphic ice features. In this image, parallel white streamers of newly formed sea ice pushed out to open sea by the strong offshore winds are visible together with a characteristic pocket of open water, called a polynya. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, that consists of two twin satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B), allows developing innovative applications for sea ice monitoring, thanks to the onboard instruments that can retrieve accurate information about sea ice extent and composition."
"sea-riiser-larsen-ice-shelf-eastern-weddell-sea-antarctica"	"Today will mark a crucial step towards the protection of Antarctica, as the European Commission and international partners will discuss the way forward in the creation of large-scale Marine Protected Areas in the waters of the white continent. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 January 2021, shows the sea off the Riiser-Larsen Ice Shelf in the eastern Weddell Sea - Antarctica. The view captures large sea ice floes being pushed away from the continental shelf by wind action. This area is an important biodiversity hotspot for Antarctica. A colony of more than 4,000 Emperor Penguins has been observed in the area during the nesting period. The Copernicus Sentinel satellite open data and the information products from its Climate Change and Marine Environment Monitoring services will be available to provide authoritative and science-based knowledge to inform policy-making and monitor implementation measures."
"sea-snot-marmara-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 June 2021, shows the mucilage that is plaguing the Sea of Marmara. The image shows a detail of the coastline of the city of Bostanci where the sea snot formed a thick film, several hundred metres wide. Mucilage appeared at the beginning of May 2021. The combination of persistent hot temperatures and high pressure in this part of the Mediterranean Sea, which is rich in anthropogenic nutrients, has developed the optimal conditions for the abnormal growth of mucilage. The presence of these blooms is causing serious environmental damage to the marine biodiversity and local fisheries, and the Turkish government has recently announced that it will take actions to tackle the recurrence of such dangerous bloom in the coming years. Data from Copernicus missions are particularly useful for estimating the concentration of chlorophyll and for monitoring water quality."
"sea-surface-temperature-anomaly-mediterranean-0"	"This visualisation, based on data delivered by the Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS), shows the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the Mediterranean Sea, which is affected by the ongoing heatwave in Europe. As shown in the visualisation, the SST anomalies reached peaks of +5°C above average in some parts of the Mediterranean Sea off the Italian North-Western and the French South-Eastern coasts. The Copernicus Marine Service provides open data and services key to the monitoring of the marine environment and the effects of climate change on these areas."
"sea-surface-temperature-baltic-sea-kattegat-and-skagerrak"	"The unusually hot summer of 2020 is having severe consequences on the environment at high latitudes, and in particular in the Baltic Sea. This images shows the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) as measured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 16 August in the southern part of the Baltic Sea and the Kattegat and Skagerrak straits. SST reached values above 24°C along the coasts of Poland, Russia, Lithuania and Sweden, and about 22°C in the Kattegat. These data, as reported by the Danish Meteorologic Institute, represent a SST thermal anomaly of approximately 3-4°C with respect to the 1985 - 2003 reference period. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are both equipped with the SLSTR Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer from which SST data are retrieved. Sea surface temperature data is used as an input for weather and ocean forecasting, to observe and monitor ocean current systems and ocean fronts, eddies, upwelling areas, marine ecosystems and the development of large scale El Niño/La Niña events."
"sea-surface-temperature-southern-baltic-sea-beginning-july-2021"	"This image shows the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) as measured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 6 July 2021 over the southern part of the Baltic Sea. The multiple heatwaves ongoing in northern Europe are having severe consequences on the environment at high latitudes, and in particular in the Baltic Sea area. In addition to the numerous air temperature records broken, the SST reached values close to those of tropical waters. As shown in this image, the Sea Surface Temperature reached values above 25°C along the coasts of Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. As reported by the Danish Meteorologic Institute, these data represent an SST thermal anomaly of approximately +4°C with respect to the 1985 - 2001 reference period. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are equipped with the SLSTR Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer which enables to retrieve SST data. Sea Surface Temperature data are used as an input for weather and ocean forecasting to observe and monitor ocean current systems, marine ecosystems etc."
"seasonal-air-quality-deterioration-new-delhi"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 2 November 2022, shows smoke engulfing the skies of north-western India. Every year, in the autumn, air quality in northern India is affected by the burning of fires started by farmers after the harvesting of rice fields . A few days ago, the concentration of particles harmful for human health in New Delhi was reported to have reached hazardous levels, almost 40 times the daily maximum amount recommended by the World Health Organisation. In parallel to Copernicus satellite data, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) monitors and forecasts air quality on a global scale by assessing the concentration of air pollutants and modelling their transport and dispersion."
"seaweed-farms-south-korea"	"This image, acquired on 28 December 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites and processed by Erwan Rivault, shows numerous seaweed farms in the South Jeolla Province, South Korea. In this image, the seaweed farms appear like dark squares and rectangles because the seaweed grow on ropes, which are held near the surface by buoys: this technique ensures that the seaweed stays close enough to the surface to receive enough light during high tide but do not scrape against the bottom during low tide. Seaweed aquaculture is common along the coast of South Jeolla Province: it produces more than 80 per cent of the seaweed farmed in South Korea. In comparison to other types of food production, seaweed farming has a light environmental footprint because it does not require freshwater or fertiliser. Among the various Copernicus services, the Marine Service data can support aquaculture farms thanks to available marine data such as temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, water quality, biochemistry, ocean currents and waves."
"sediment-loads-west-coast-madagascar"	"In Madagascar, soil erosion caused by unsustainable land management is a major environmental issue. This is largely the consequence of nearly a century of logging of Madagascar’s rainforests and coastal mangroves, which has resulted in extensive land clearing and high levels of coastal erosion. This phenomenon is especially visible on the west coast, where large amounts of sediments are regularly transported into the sea by fluvial waters after heavy rains. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 April 2022, shows the waters of the Betsiboka and Mahavavy river estuaries turned brown because of the massive sediment transports caused by recent heavy rains."
"sediment-patterns-lake-erie"	"Lake Erie, nestled between the United States and Canada, is one of the five North American Great Lakes. Over the weekend of 18-19 March 2023, the Great Lakes region was swept by powerful winds and freezing temperatures, resulting in significant sediment disturbances throughout Lake Erie. The strength of the winds created surface turbulence, agitating sediments and generating multiple patterns of turbidity in the water, as visible in this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image acquired on 20 March. Copernicus plays a crucial role in monitoring water quality worldwide by providing daily (clouds permitting) satellite observations that enable scientists to identify and track changes in water quality."
"sediment-plume-rhone-river"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 May 2021, shows the sediment plume discharged into the Mediterranean Sea by the mouth of the Rhône river in southern France. Between 10 and 11 May 2021, heavy rainfalls affected the departments of Rhône, Loire, Haute-Loire and Ardèche in southern France. According to Météo France, the rainfall caused record daily accumulations for the month of May in some areas. As a result, rivers swelled, inducing floods of the Rhône River, which, as this image shows, was still gushing into the Mediterranean Sea the day after the storm episode. Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a mission composed of two satellites. Each satellite carries a high-resolution multispectral sensor to monitor vegetation changes and to provide information on pollution in lakes and coastal waters."
"sediment-plumes-north-sea-waters"	"Several extratropical rainstorms have hit Northern Europe during the second week of February 2022. Amongst them, Storm Eunice has heavily impacted the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and parts of Germany. The exceptionally strong winds, whose speed exceeded 180 km/m in some areas of Southern England, have caused 18 causalities and forced tens of thousands of people to live without electricity for several days. These winds have generated waves as tall as 7 metres, causing the displacement of large quantities of sediments in the North Sea. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 26 February 2022, shows a long trail of sediments, moved by the aforementioned storms, spanning from the oriental coast of the United Kingdom to the Dutch coast."
"sediment-swirls-caspian-sea"	"Along its southeastern coasts, the Caspian Sea is often marked by colourful swirls of permanently turbid water. The area in which these sediment plumes form is referred to as “marine shallows” and is under 30 meters deep. The geometry of floating sediments strongly depends on weather conditions. In this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image captured on 2 September 2020, besides floating sediments in the marine shallows, various sediment swirls that have formed in the last days of August along the southern Iranian coast (bottom of the image) are visible. Their formation was caused by strong winds that moved the sediments along the coast causing a sequence of swirls in a clockwise expansion pattern. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, is equipped with a specific optical sensor, called the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that allows to measure ocean colour and gather information about marine biological constituents. For coastal and shallow waters, the colouration of waters can also result from the release of ground water loaded with suspended sediment and organic matter, as well as re-suspension due to wave agitation. Initially designed for research studies in marine biology and the carbon cycle, this observation technique has spawned several applications towards marine area management and coastal zone management."
"sediments-gulf-mexico"	"In 2020 the Atlantic Ocean has experienced a record season of hurricanes and many of these have hit the southern coast of the United States. The latest to do so was Zeta, the twenty-seventh storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which caused at least 6 deaths, mass power outages and floods in Louisiana. Heavy rain caused by the passage of Hurricane Zeta over the Mississippi Valley caused the river and its tributaries to swell, carrying large amounts of mud and sediment into the Gulf of Mexico. As shown in this image acquired by one of Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 2 November 2020, the amount of sediment was such that it tainted the sea in a coastal area (about 500 km long) that runs from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to the coast of Texas. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, which allow us to monitor water quality and sediment transport with coastal areas."
"sediments-mediterranean-sea"	"After a long period of drought, Southern Italy is counting damages after being hit by severe weather during the last weekend of September 2020. Landslides, floods, hundreds of evacuated people have been recorded in the Campania Region, while in Sicily, a rescuer from the National Coast Guard died during a search & rescue intervention. This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 September 2020, shows sediments gushing into the Mediterranean Sea from rivers in the Campania Region. The sediments, transported by the strong wind along the Sorrento Peninsula and Ischia island, form large and unusual plumes in these waters. Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a two-satellite mission. Each satellite carries a high-resolution multispectral imager to monitor changes in vegetation. It also provides information on pollution in lakes and coastal waters."
"seismic-crisis-sao-jorge-island-azores"	"The volcanic island of São Jorge in the Azores Archipelago, Portugal, is going through an intense seismic crisis. Authorities have activated emergency plans as a preventive measure. Copernicus Sentinel-1 image acquired on 21 March 2022."
"seismo-volcanic-activity-la-palma-spain"	"The island of La Palma in the Canary Islands is going through a seismic crisis, with more than 4,200 earthquakes recorded between 11 and 16 September 2021, some reaching a magnitude above 3.4. Scientists from the Instituto Volcanológico de Canarias attribute the intense seismic activity to magma rising inside a volcanic structure that has been dormant since 1971. However, it is not yet clear if this crisis will culminate in a volcanic eruption. On this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 16 September 2021, the seismic swarm is geo-localised. It also includes indicators for the epicentres and magnitude of the earthquakes that have occurred since the beginning of the seismo-volcanic crisis, as recorded by the Instituto Geográfico Nacional of Spain Data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel missions are particularly useful for studying volcanic phenomena and deformations induced by earthquakes, enabling timely responses in times of crises."
"seismo-volcanic-activity-reykjanes-peninsula-iceland"	"The Reykjanes Peninsula in Southwest Iceland is experiencing a seismic crisis, with more than 37,000 earthquakes recorded since 24 February 2021, some reaching above magnitude 5.0. Scientists from the Paris Globe Institute of Physics and the Icelandic Meteorological Office attribute the intense seismic activity to magma rising inside a volcanic structure that has been dormant for over 800 years. However, it is not yet clear if this crisis will culminate in a volcanic eruption. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 14 March 2021, shows a cloudless view of the Icelandic region affected by the seismic swarm. It also includes indicators for the epicentres and magnitude of the numerous earthquakes that occurred between 12 and 14 March, as recorded by the Icelandic Meteorological Institute. Data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel missions are particularly useful for studying volcanic phenomena and deformations induced by earthquakes, enabling timely responses in times of crises."
"seventh-paroxysm-etna-volcano"	"The seventh paroxysm of the Etna volcano within two weeks occurred on the morning of 28 February 2021. This episode was very brief but rather powerful: the lava fountains did not reach significant heights, but an impressive column of volcanic debris and hot gases was emitted. The ash fallout reached several municipalities more than 20 km east from the crater, and the massive fallout of rock fragments ejected from the volcano slowed down the transit on the Messina to Catania motorway. This new image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 February 2021 at 9:50 UTC (about one hour and 30 min after the eruptive event), shows the ash plume drifting away in the Mediterranean Sea."
"several-active-wildfires-alaska"	"The fire season has started in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. According to the Alaska Bureau of Land Management, within the first days of the 2022 meteorological summer, more than 16,700 hectares have been affected by wildfires, the largest area since 2014. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 6 June 2022, shows multiple active wildfires in southwestern Alaska. Several of these fires were ignited because of a storm that generated nearly 5,000 lightning strikes between 4 and 5 June. The spatial and temporal resolution of the open satellite data supplied by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites allows the monitoring of the effects of wildfires across the world."
"several-wildfires-raging-new-mexico"	"Multiple wildfires are currently burning across New Mexico, USA, with devastating consequences. Several communities have been evacuated, electric power has been proactively shut off and multiple roads have been closed to keep people in the area safe. Between Friday 22 and Saturday 23 April 2022, The governor of New Mexico declared a state of emergency for Colfax, Lincoln, San Miguel, Valencia, and Mora counties to make funding and state resources available for communities battling the ongoing wildfires. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on Saturday 23 April 2022, shows the Calf Canyon and the Hermits Peak Fires, which are mainly affecting the communities of San Miguel and Mora. The two fires had started independently, but the strong winds and low humidity levels in the area caused them to merge and spread through dry vegetation in Northern New Mexico on Friday 22 April. The overall burnt area, which is visible in the image, stands at approximately 17,000 hectares. Thanks to their high frequency of acquisition, Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite data are an important source of valuable information, which can be used to monitor the vegetation status and contribute to the assessment of the consequences of a wildfire event."
"severe-drought-affecting-argentina"	"A severe drought is currently gripping Argentina with some of the driest conditions experienced in 30 years. Grave consequences are expected to be felt in the agricultural sector. In fact, the corn planting season is approaching, but the extreme dryness of the soil has forced farmers to stall seeding activities, putting the 2023 harvest at risk. The consequences of water scarcity in the Pampas plains near Buenos Aires are visible when comparing these two images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites in September 2018 (above) and September 2022 (below). The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, which provide drought indicators and early warning for droughts in Europe (EDO) and worldwide (GDO)."
"severe-drought-affecting-horn-africa"	"The Horn of Africa is affected by one of the most severe droughts in decades. Although April is supposed to be one of the wettest months in the region, a La Niña-induced drought is persisting. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 17 May 2021 (left) and 22 May 2022 (right), show the effects of water scarcity in the Gode area, in the Somali Region of Ethiopia. The country is experiencing the worst drought since 1981: many crops have failed and over a million livestock has died, two-thirds of which in the Somali Region. The extreme drought is having devastating consequences on the local population. According to the World Food Programme, the number of people in the Horn of Africa pushed into hunger as a direct consequence of the current drought could rise from the current 14 million to 20 million by the end of the year. In Ethiopia alone, the estimated number of people suffering from food shortage currently stands at 7.2 million."
"severe-drought-affecting-iberian-peninsula"	"According to the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) data by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) European Drought Observatory (EDO), the Iberian Peninsula is suffering from a prolonged drought. In the first ten days of June, 60% of the territory was under “alert” conditions. The drought has had a severe impact on crops, and the persistent lack of precipitation and warmer-than-average conditions have led to negative soil moisture and river flow anomalies. The CDI is a drought early warning indicator that has been specifically developed to monitor agricultural drought. It analyses anomalies in spatial patterns of precipitation, soil moisture, and greenness of vegetation to identify areas impacted by drought. All the data published by the CEMS European Drought Observatory are accessible here."
"severe-drought-affecting-portugal"	"According to the latest climatological bulletin of the Portuguese Institute of Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA), in March 2023, 48% of Portugal was in drought conditions. The worst affected areas are in the south of the country. This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 24 April, shows Algarve, Portugal’s southernmost region and one of those most affected by the drought.

"severe-drought-andalucia-spain"	"Spain is experiencing a severe drought. The winter precipitation levels recorded in 2021-2022 are 35% below the historical average, causing significant problems for the Spanish watershed environments and their biodiversity. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 March 2021 (left) and 2 March 2022 (right), show the effects of the ongoing drought in the Doñana National Park in Andalucía, southern Spain. The image on the left clearly shows the local vegetation in full bloom a year ago. The image on the right, on the other hand, shows the same area a year later, with a visible lack of water and of vegetation in the marshes, as a consequence of the insufficient winter rainfall. The Doñana National Park is home to a rich biodiversity, which has been strongly affected by the ongoing drought. In fact, the results of winter sampling carried out by the Biological Station of Doñana support the estimate of a twentyfold reduction in the number of amphibians in a year, as a consequence of the lack of water in the marshes."
"severe-drought-california-usa"	"Due to the severe drought that is currently affecting California and the surrounding region of the United States, the water reserve of Lake Oroville, a crucial Californian water reservoir, is at only 38% of its capacity— about 54% of its historical average. Despite the heavy snowfall of early 2021, the largest water reservoirs in California are at critically low levels in the lead-up to what is predicted to be another dry summer. With its 65 km² area, and when at full capacity, Lake Oroville can provide enough water for an estimated seven million households, but the reservoir also helps control flooding in the region and contributes to the ecosystems around it and downstream, as well as to the operation of hydroelectrical facilities and the irrigation of agricultural land. Imaged with Copernicus Sentinel open data, the shores of Lake Oroville show clear signs of its low water level, while the scars of the devastating North Complex Fire, which burned through 350 km² of Northern California between August and September 2020, are visible east of the lake. This image of Lake Oroville was acquired on 5 March (the image from 10 March is cloudy) by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. They deliver data that can be used to accurately map bodies of water, respond to the changes in their ecosystems and extract critical information during times of drought."
"severe-drought-continues-grip-portugal"	"Intense drought conditions have been affecting Portugal for months, following unusually warm temperatures and lower than average precipitations. According to the national meteorological organisation of Portugal – Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) – the extreme drought conditions in the country have increased throughout June 2022, vis-à-vis the end of May 2022. On 30 June, 96% of the Portuguese territory was experiencing either “extreme” or “severe” drought conditions. Several hydrographic basins in Portugal are currently showing clear signs of the consequences of the ongoing drought. One example is the Aldo Lindoso reservoir, shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 6 July, which is currently at only 15.8% of its capacity. The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which provide drought indicators and early warning for droughts in Europe and worldwide."
"severe-drought-continues-south-america"	"A severe drought continues to plague South America as a result of the ongoing La Niña climate phenomenon. In Argentina, predictions indicate that the harvest could decrease by 50% in 2023 due to a lack of precipitation. Uruguay has also been heavily affected by the drought, with some regions only having to rely on only 10% of their usual water supply. These two images, acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, show the impact of the drought on the Paraná River basin region in January 2022 (left) and January 2023 (right). The Copernicus Emergency Management Service runs the Global Drought Observatory, which provides information on the state of drought in South America. Additional information are available here."
"severe-drought-portugal"	"According to the national meteorological organisation of Portugal – Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) – 97% of the Portuguese territory is affected by “severe drought” conditions, following unusually warm temperatures and lower than average precipitations. The past month was in fact the warmest May in 92 years, with an average temperature of 19.19 °C, combined with an average precipitation of only 8.9 mm. The drought has severely affected the Bravura Reservoir, situated in southern Portugal, which was at 14.6% of its capacity in May 2022. The effects of water scarcity on the reservoir are visible when comparing the images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 June 2017 and 8 June 2022. The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, which provide drought indicators and early warning for droughts in Europe and worldwide."

"severe-heatwave-south-america"	"South America is currently confronted with a severe heatwave. On 11 March, Buenos Aires in Argentina recorded its highest-ever temperature for March at 38.6°C, while Mercedes in Uruguay saw the temperature soar to a record value of 40.5°C. On the same day, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite measured the Land Surface Temperature, which reached above 48°C in some areas of Argentina and Uruguay as early as 13:12 UTC (10:12 local time). Note: this data shows Land Surface Temperature (i.e. the temperature of the soil) and not air temperature at ground level. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are equipped with the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument, allowing for accurate worldwide monitoring of land surface temperature."
"severe-heatwave-south-america-october-2020"	"A severe heatwave is currently affecting South America, and several temperature records have been beaten in the first two weeks of the local spring. Extreme temperatures have been recorded in several countries in the past few days. The city of Pozo Hondo in Paraguay has recorded an all-time maximum of 45.5°C on 26 September, beating the old 45°C record. Argentina’s all-time record for September has been beaten in the city of Resistencia with a temperature of 43.5°C. But the most affected country is Brazil, which had already been hit by a heatwave in the first two weeks of September. In the last days of the month, a new September national record was set with 44.1°C on 30 September. October started with the new highest value for the maximum temperature of the month, registered in the city of Corumba with 43.4°C. Other records have been beaten across the country. But all these values could be exceeded again in the next few days because the heatwave is still ongoing and new records can be expected, according to weather forecasts. This image is a Land Surface Temperature map with values retrieved from the Sentinel-3 data that have been acquired on 1 October 2020 over central and southern Brazil and shows that in many areas the soil temperature reaches the 55°C marker or exceeds it. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed by two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are equipped with the Sea Land Surface Temperature Radiometer instrument (SLSTR) allowing to determine the Land Surface Temperature (LST) thanks to the data collected by its thermal. The Land Surface Temperature is an important parameter to monitor glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost and the vegetation in the Earth's ecosystems. Land surface temperature maps are also used for commercial agricultural purposes to evaluate irrigation requirements during summer periods when crops may be exposed to heat stress or, in contrast, during winter periods, when crops and trees may be exposed to damaging frost."
"severe-heatwave-southern-asia"	"A severe heatwave is affecting southern Asia: on 26 April 2022, the Dadu weather station in Pakistan recorded an extreme temperature of 47 °C, among the highest temperatures recorded in the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. According to a recent update of an Indian Meteorological Department study, while the period from March to June is usually very hot, the current heatwave has an unusual character and is likely to be a manifestation of climate change. The extreme weather will have significant consequences on the health of over one billion people and threatens to damage wheat yields across the region. In fact, some of the areas most hit by the heatwave are also among the biggest producers of wheat. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 26 April 2022, shows the areas most affected by the extreme temperatures. The Copernicus Sentinel missions retrieve accurate data essential to assess the impacts of climate change on the environment. In the European State of Climate 2022 report published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), an entire section is dedicated to assessing the global context. This section looks at several global Climate Indicators, including temperature."
"severe-snowfall-hit-romania"	"The heavy snowfall that hit Romania in the last week of January 2023 caused widespread damage and disruptions across the country. Over 30,000 people were left without electricity, and road transportation was severely impacted by snow and ice. The affected areas saw fallen trees and electricity poles, while some low-lying regions were also flooded. The local authorities have been working to clear the roads, remove debris, and evacuate the water to restore normal conditions. This image captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 2 February 2023 provides a glimpse into the impact of the snowfall on the city of Tulcea, in the west of the country. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites enable the monitoring of snow-covered surfaces with high-resolution imaging."
"severe-weather-affecting-ouarzazate-province-morocco"	"Severe weather conditions recently hit Morocco, causing snow cover to reach up to 1.7 metres in some areas of the Ouarzazate province. The heavy snowfall significantly affected the local population, and 9,000 families will benefit from emergency humanitarian aid, consisting mainly of food and blankets. This extreme weather has also had a positive effect with an increase in the volume of water stored in the Mansour Dahbi reservoir, which doubled in just a few days. This increase is visible when comparing these two images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite before and after the heavy snowfall, on 7 and 19 February. The Sentinel-1 satellite uses radar imaging to capture images of the Earth's surface, even in cloudy conditions or darkness. They can be used to map and track changes in snow and ice cover, including the extent of glaciers, sea ice, and snow cover on land."
"severe-weather-hits-italy-november-2022"	"On 22 November 2022, cyclone Denise hit Italy. Along the Tyrrhenian coast, severe floods occurred in the Campania region, where one casualty was reported. Along the Adriatic coast, a storm surge resulted in the highest tide level ever recorded in the northern Adriatic Sea, with a peak of 209 cm at Bocca di Lido, near Venice. The storm surge caused severe floods in Emilia Romagna, and the Italian Civil Protection decided to activate the Copernicus EMS Rapid Mapping module to map the affected areas. After the record tide, the meteorological and marine conditions for further sustained high tides persisted in the northern Adriatic Sea. As shown in this image, on 24 November, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured MOSE (the mobile dyke system built to protect Venice and its lagoon from high tides) while it had been deployed to preserve the lagoon from a new high tide event."
"severe-wildfires-are-ongoing-alberta-canada"	"During the first weekend of May 2023, severe wildfires broke out in the western Canadian province of Alberta. The fires have caused widespread damage and prompted local authorities to declare a state of emergency. 25,000 residents have been forced to evacuate their homes, and over 122,000 hectares have already burnt. Local Authorities have called the situation ""unprecedented,"" while firefighting efforts are ongoing to contain the fires. The smoke cloud (1,500 km long) generated by the fires has reached the Arctic Circle, as shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-3 image of 6 May. Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide open data which can help track and map areas affected by wildfires, allowing for a better assessment of the damage caused by these natural disasters."
"severe-wildfires-caused-record-emissions-russia-during-summer-2021"	"The wildfires that affected the Sakha Republic during the summer of 2021 were characterised by the number of fires, the size of the areas that were burning simultaneously, their intensity, and their persistence. According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), a record quantity of carbon emissions was released into the atmosphere as a result of Russian wildfires, while more than 10 million hectares were burned in summer 2021 (official data of the Russian Federal Forestry Agency). This image, acquired by one of the Sentinel-3 satellites on 22 September, shows the burn scar of the largest fire that affected the Yakutsk area in 2021. It burned continuously from the end of June until it was put out by rains in mid-August. The CAMS data are a global benchmark for monitoring dangerous emissions in the atmosphere from different sources (wildfires, volcanoes, etc)."
"severe-wildfires-continue-affect-canadas-provinces-alberta-and-british"	"Out-of-control wildfires raging across western Canada continue to pose a significant threat to both populated areas and natural landscapes. Entire communities have been forced to evacuate due to the escalating inferno. Despite the relentless efforts of firefighters and emergency services, the blazes have proved challenging to contain and extinguish, with strong winds and dry conditions hindering progress. To fight the escalating crisis, the Canadian government has mobilised additional resources, including military aircraft and personnel in support of firefighting endeavours."
"severe-wildfires-ongoing-north-america"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 10 September, shows the massive smoke clouds generated by the multiple wildfires which are raging on the West Coast of the United States and in Southwestern Canada. According to the United States’ Northwest Interagency Coordination Center, more than 1,000 km² have burnt in Oregon and Washington states, and thousands of people have been evacuated. One of the largest fires is the Cedar Creek Fire (image detail on the right), which has burnt more than 351 km² so far. Copernicus satellite data is key for monitoring the overall extent of burnt areas around the world."
"severny-island-russia"	"This image, acquired on 25 August 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites and processed by Iban Ameztoy, shows a detail of the northern edge of Severny Island, the northern island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago (Russia). Severny Island is part of Russian Arctic National Park (RANP), a marine Protected Area playing a significant role in the conservation of rare and protected endemic species of the Arctic fauna and flora, included in the IUCN Red List and/or in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. In the summer of 2020, several bird species unusual for the latitude were spotted in RANP: Ivan Mizin, deputy director for research at RANP, attributes this to the strong winds caused by the global climate change that push birds further north. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in the Arctic region."
"seville-andalucia"	"The city of Sevilla is located in the plain of the Guadalquivir River, in the southwest of Spain, in the region of Andalusia. It has a municipal population of around 703,000 and a metropolitan population of around 1.2 million, making it the fourth largest city in Spain and the 31st most populous municipality in the European Union. The city of Sevilla is working to develop ""urban ecology"" projects focused on the optimisation of resources and the reduction of fossil fuel consumption. To do this, local authorities have focused on sustainable urban mobility and has built 120 km of cycle paths throughout the city. This false colour image composed using data acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 September 2020, shows the urban area of Seville and the plain of the Guadalquivir River. Data fromCopernicus Sentinel satellites can be used to monitor parameters useful for evaluating the quality of life of in cities around the world."
"shikine-island-japan"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 24 October 2020, shows the Japanese volcanic island of Shikine-jima (式根島), part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. Due to the volcanic origin and nature of the island, the sea water around it is renowned for its high concentration of CO2. The CO2 rich environment around the island is similar to what researchers have predicted will occur in oceans worldwide in the coming years due to climate change. Researchers at the University of Tsukuba (Japan) and the University of Plymouth (UK) have selected the island for a new study on the combined effects of increasing plastic pollution and CO2 emissions on the marine environment. The results of this research endeavour have shown that bacterial communities important to a thriving marine ecosystem have declined, while harmful species have been flourishing. This new composition in bacterial communities can be harmful by contributing to ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, etc. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites have provided important data for an innovative study published in 2020 about marine debris detection, which has resulted in a positive first step in advancing the field of marine litter detection."
"ship-emissions-space"	"Maritime traffic has a significative impact on air quality: ships generate emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as a consequence of the composition of the fuel used to power them. In recent years, emissions have increased in a significative way, and as reported in a study commissioned by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), greenhouse gas emissions from shipping increased by 9.6% from 2012 to 2018, as rising demand outweighed efficiency improvements. This image shows the average value of Tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) detected between January and July 2020 by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P Satellite for the open water areas of the European Region (Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, etc). In this visualisation, the ""highway"" that the vessels use to navigate the Strait of Gibraltar is easily visible because all the ships follow approximately the same route and reject a significative amount of NO₂ in the atmosphere. For the same reason (long stays at destination areas before unloading their cargo), the areas around port areas like Rotterdam, Marseille, Venice, Barcelona, etc. appear red in this visualisation. Nitrogen dioxide is a product of the combustion of fuels, in this instance from the burning of marine diesel and heavy fuel oil. Thanks to the TROPOMI instrument, that is onboard of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P Satellite, it is possible to see these shipping lanes with a spatial resolution of 7.5Km by 3.5 Km, a significant improvement when compared with the resolution of previous missions. The detection of NO2 concentrations in the atmosphere helps to monitor anthropogenic activities (notably fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning) and study natural processes (such as microbiological processes in soils, wildfires or lightning)."
"shipping-russian-arctic-ocean"	"During the summer of 2020, the amount of sea ice in the Russian Arctic Ocean has reached minimum levels compared to average reference values. Due to the reduced quantity of ice, the Northern Sea Route (also known as the Polar Silk Road) has seen an early start for the tankers and cargo ships traffic. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 12 July, shows a caravan of three ships navigating through the sea ice. These are the Russian nuclear-powered ice-breaker Yamal, opening the road for Happy Diamond and Happy Dragon, two Dutch cargo ships en route to the Siberian port of Tiksi among the sea ice of the Laptev Sea (Lat: 76, Lng: 150.7).

This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 22 May 2020, shows the town of Khatanga in the Taymyr Peninsula that belongs to the Siberian Federal District. Being located on the Khatanga River, in the Far North of Russia, Khatanga is inside the Arctic Circle and is one of the northernmost inhabited locations of Russia. Copernicus Sentinel-2, with a maximum revisit time of five days, is very useful for monitoring the impact of climate change in such an important and delicate environment as the Arctic Circle."
"sicily-and-saharan-dust-space-italy"	"At the end of the first week of February, three spring-like days raised daily temperature highs on the island of Sicily to over 20°C, with Palermo recording values of up to 29.5°C. On 6 February, the almost cloudless sky over the region allowed one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites to acquire a beautiful image of Sicily and its surrounding waters, showing multiple interesting natural phenomena. The left side of the image shows a partial view of the massive cloud of Saharan dust, which has been affecting southwestern European countries. Along the southern coast of Sicily, the presence of a phytoplankton bloom often observed in this area can be seen from space. This impressive bloom is fuelled by specific environmental conditions: an abundance of sediment released into the water from sandy beaches and the high concentration of nutrients that can be found in these coastal waters. On the eastern side of the island, this Sentinel-3 acquisition also shows a cloud-free view of the Mount Etna volcano, whose four craters have been particularly active during the first week of February. An ash plume can be seen east of the summit snow-covered sector. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B), provides multispectral data with over 21 spectral bands that allow the development of innovative applications for both marine and land monitoring activities."

"somme-bay-france"	"This image, acquired on 6 March 2021 by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, shows the Somme Bay in France. Somme Bay (Baie de Somme) is a large estuary in the Picardy region of France, protected as a RAMSAR site and a Natura 2000 site under the Habitats Directive due to the exceptionally rich ecosystems it hosts. Six rivers, including the Somme river, drain via the Somme Bay into the English Channel, interweaving mudflats, stony beaches, sand dunes and wet meadows that stretch over a surface area of more than 100 km². The Somme Bay is one of the most important European ornithological sites, host to more than 350 species of birds and numerous other fauna and flora habitats, including France’s largest colony of seals. This coastal zone is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Numerous coastal protection activities have been implemented in the area to prevent the degradation of its ecosystems due to coastal erosion, which has a particularly strong impact along the English Channel. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive is a legislation framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy. To support these efforts, the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service has recently released the Coastal Zones datasets, a new product that has been developed to monitor the complex dynamics of coastal environments and to support actions to mitigate the effects of climate change and, in particular, sea level rise."
"south-asia-engulfed-smoke"	"Multiple agricultural fires are ongoing in South Asia. They are causing high levels of PM2.5, which creates numerous air pollution hotspots. In Laos, the smoke clouds have led to dangerously poor air quality, forcing schools to close. One of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 captured the thick smoke cloud on 4 April, highlighting the widespread impact of the fires. Through its satellite data and Services, Copernicus enables the monitoring of the effects of wildfires, such as smoke plumes and air quality impacts."
"south-china-sea"	"In December 2020, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) updated its “Red List of Threatened Species“, declaring 31 species extinct and 35,765 threatened with extinction around the world (almost a third of the total number of species listed in the Union's global programme). This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 5 December 2020, shows the South China Sea in the southwestern Guangdong province of the People's Republic of China, the habitat of the Carcharhinus Obsoletus shark: this species, one of the 31, has been overfished for over a century and this, according to IUCN, has caused its extinction. Data retrieved by the Copernicus Marine Monitoring Service can be used for planning sustainable fisheries activities."
"south-great-britain-covered-snow"	"On 24 January heavy snow fell over wide swaths of Great Britain after a rare snowstorm hit the island. The next day, residents woke up to a thick blanket of snow in Wales, London and the Midlands, and several coronavirus vaccination and testing centres in England and Wales had been closed due to the severe weather. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for snow for an area stretching from coast to coast in Southern England and ending just south of Manchester. This rare image, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 25 January 2021, shows the south of Great Britain covered with snow.

"spain-affected-third-severe-heatwave-summer"	"This image, captured on 10 August by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, shows the Iberian Peninsula as it is undergoing the third severe summer heatwave. Among the affected regions, Spain suffers the most from the effects of the high temperatures. The Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) has issued red alerts, indicating an extreme risk, due to elevated temperatures in Castilla-La Mancha, Murcia, and Valencia. Additionally, orange alerts have been issued for Andalusia, Aragon, Catalonia, and Madrid. The Canary Islands are also grappling with substantial amounts of Saharan dust, leading to a decline in air quality. On the same day this image was acquired, Valencia Airport reached a historic high of 46.8°C, marking the highest temperature since records began in 1966. These heatwaves follow the record-breaking temperatures highlighted in July by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. More details are available here."
"spain-plagued-wildfires-summer-2022"	"The wildfire crisis which started in Europe at the beginning of June is not over yet. According to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), one of the modules of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), in 2022 more than 662,000 hectares have burnt in EU countries (data updated on 13 August). Spain is the European nation most affected, with more than 250,000 ha burned, and wildfires continue to rage across the country. As shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 18 August, a new disastrous fire is ongoing near Bejis, in the Valencian Autonomous Community.

"spain-timanfaya-national-park"	"This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 28 November 2022, shows the Timanfaya National Park, on the Spanish island of Lanzarote, in the Canarias archipelago. The park is unique because it is entirely composed of volcanic landscapes. Volcanic activity is still taking place, but the last eruption occurred in the 19th century. The flora is scarce, because of the desertic nature of the environment and the scarcity of rain."
"spains-yesa-reservoir-severely-affected-extreme-drought"	"The Yesa reservoir, situated in the Pyrenees mountain range in Spain, is a source of drinking water for tens of thousands of people living in the Navarra and Aragón autonomous regions. After a very dry summer, in which several heatwaves with record-breaking temperatures hit Western Europe, Spain remains gripped by an extreme drought. The Yesa reservoir is currently at 16% of its capacity, the lowest level recorded at this time of the year since 1980. The striking difference in water levels is visible in these images, acquired on 2 July 2022 (above) and 20 September 2022 (below) by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. Open data retrieved by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide key information useful to accurately map water bodies and extract critical information during periods of drought."
"spanish-maresme-train-line-threatened-effects-climate-change"	"The picturesque Maresme train line, the oldest in the country, runs along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in Spain. Its location makes it particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, namely the process of coastal erosion. Last week, a storm surge eroded the foundations of the train line, causing the sea waves to sweep away a section of the tracks, forcing a temporary interruption of rail traffic. The local mayors are proposing to permanently move the Maresme train line away from the coast, a solution supported by the geologists at the Observatori del GeoRisc research institute. They argue that because of the effects of climate change, the sea level will rise and beaches will be further eroded, making the train line unsustainable in the long run. The damaged coastal area, between Pineda de Mar and Malgral de Mar, is visible in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 2 April 2022. The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) work closely together on a comprehensive coastal monitoring service to address the complex dynamics of coastal erosion, whereas the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) supports adaptation and mitigation policies by providing consistent and authoritative information about climate change dynamics and consequences."
"spanish-reservoirs-lowest-capacity-27-years"	"After exceptionally dry spring and summer seasons, the drought situation is finally improving in Spain. However, the country’s reservoirs are still affected by the consequences of the prolonged dry period and lack of rain. According to the Ministry for Ecological Transition (Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico), Spanish reservoirs now stand at only 31.7% of their total capacity. This is the lowest level recorded in the past 27 years, about 20% less than last year’s figure. The difference in water levels is evident when comparing these two images of the Almendra reservoir, located in the Castilla y León autonomous region, which were acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites only one year apart, in October 2021 and October 2022. Open data captured by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide key information useful to accurately mapping water bodies and extracting critical insight into the effects of drought."
"spring-floods-north-america"	"The upper Mississippi basin in the United States is currently facing one of its worst flooding situations in decades due to the excess snowmelt being drained by the river basin. The severity of the flooding in Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin, one of the worst affected areas, is depicted in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 May. According to the National Weather Service, some areas in the region have seen their third-highest floodwater peak on record.

"spring-heatwave-australia"	"An extreme heatwave has been affecting a large part of Australia since 27 November, as several records of hight temperatures have been broken in the last three days. It is quite possible that November 2020 could end up being one of the hottest Novembers ever recorded by the Australian Bureau Of Meteorology (BOM). In particular, Sidney reported its hottest November night on record with an overnight temperature of 25.4°C on Saturday 29 November, while on 28 November New South Wales reached its hottest November day ever, with a value of 46.9°C in Smithville. The heatwave is also having serious consequences in terms of fire danger, with 62 bush and grass fires reported on 29 November by the Rural Fire Service (RFS) in eastern and north-eastern parts of New South Wales. This image shows the Land Surface Temperature (LST) map over Australia, as recorded by the two Copernicus Sentinel-3 Satellites on 29 November 2020. This LST is the temperature of the soil and should not be confused with the air temperature. This is why it is not possible to measure the temperature of the soil in the areas covered by clouds. As shown by this map, LST values well above 50°C have been reached in Queensland and in most of the non-cloudy parts of New South Wales. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellite (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B) that are both equipped with the Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, an instrument whose main objective is to provide global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) with a very high level of accuracy (for both climatological and meteorological applications)."
"springtime-colour-north-sea-atlantic-ocean"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 April 2021, shows the ocean colour in an area of the North Sea in the north of Europe. In springtime, the North Sea becomes colourful, akin to a terrestrial biome. Numerous blooms and sediment patterns can be seen in this image of the region of the North Sea between Great Britain and Northern Europe. The light blue colour of the water in the centre of the image is due to suspended sediment and organic matter (such as phytoplankton) carried by the currents. Further north, there is a dark blue area where the surface water is relatively clear of suspended sediment and phytoplankton. The stunning milky blue colour adjacent to it is caused by coccolithophores, a type of phytoplankton that gives the water this characteristic colour. The Copernicus Sentinel satellite missions provide open data that enable high-frequency monitoring of water quality and dynamics in coastal waters."
"st-helena-island-south-carolina-usa-threatened-climate-change"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 November 2021, shows St. Helena Island in South Carolina (USA) and its lush green marshes, which are particularly extensive around the city of Beaufort. Situated on the Atlantic coast, the island has long been exposed to multiple natural phenomena linked to climate change: rising seas, increased land and sea temperatures and destructive storms. Recently, these phenomena have intensified to the point of calling into question the safety and economic stability of its vulnerable inhabitants. The island of St Helena is also home to the Gullah, an ethnic group of African Americans who have lived in the coastal areas between North Carolina and Florida since the 18th century. Copernicus Sentinel satellites gather invaluable data for monitoring coastal areas all over the world."
"state-greenland-ice-sheet-2021"	"Greenland's ice sheet was affected by two extreme events during the summer of 2021: a massive and widespread melting of the ice; and, for the first time since records began, meteorological observations of rain at the highest point of the ice sheet. According to scientists at the Danish Meteorological Institute, these two episodes contributed to 2021 being the 25th consecutive year in which the ice sheet lost more ice than it gained. Scientists also estimate that, from 1 September 1986 to 31 August 2021, the Greenland ice sheet lost around 5,500 giga tonnes of ice. Further, it is estimated that this loss contributed to a sea level rise of about 1.5 cm. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 7 November 2021, shows the Russell Glacier, one of the glaciers most studied by researchers to understand the connection between the melting of the ice sheet and rising sea levels. Open data from Copernicus Services and Sentinel satellites enable scientists to study the ice sheets in the polar regions."
"state-nature-eu-2013-2018-report-po-basin-italy"	"On 19 October 2020, the European Environment Agency published the “State of Nature in the EU 2013-2018” report, a high level report in which the state of the natural environment in the European Union is analysed using biological, geological, and ecological indicators. According to this study, the vast majority of protected landscapes and natural habitats across Europe has been rated as being in a “poor” or “bad” condition. Additionally, despite targets having been set to protect them, the population of species vital to biodiversity is continuing to decline together with the condition of their habitats . Regions with a predominantly good conservation track record are located within the Alpine arc, Croatia, Greece, Portugal and Romania. In contrast, the regions with predominantly bad conditions can be found in lowland and flat areas (e.g. Po Basin, Danube Basin, southern Sweden, Poland). This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellites on 15 September, shows the terminal part of the Po basin in Italy, one of the areas in which nature conservation has received a poor rating.

Ever Given, a 400-metre-long and 59-metre-wide 220,000-tonne container ship, ran aground on its way along the Suez Canal on 23 March 2021, obstructing maritime traffic in one of the world’s busiest waterways. Eight tugboats are involved in the recovery operations, but it is still unclear when the situation will return to normal. The plight of Ever Given is reported to have come about due to strong winds. Copernicus services include a Maritime Surveillance component that, in addition to other products, allows for the monitoring of ships and supports authorities in managing maritime traffic emergencies."
"sulfur-dioxide-emitted-fagradalsfjall-volcanic-eruption-iceland"	"This image, which shows the sulphur dioxide (SO₂) emitted by the ongoing volcanic eruption at the Fagradalsfjall mountain in Iceland, was constructed by overlaying data acquired on 3 May 2021 by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite onto a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite image of the region. Due to the absence of clouds in the area, measurements performed by instruments onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite have been able to provide data on the levels of SO₂ emitted during this new eruptive phase of Fagradalsfjall. The activity of this as-of-yet unnamed volcano has been evolving since late April 2021. The new eruptive fissures that have appeared recently have resulted in the development of intense lava fountains, reaching a height of more than 200 metres. Open data provided by Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide information indispensable to the monitoring of volcanoes globally."
"sulphur-dioxide-emitted-etna-volcano"	"This image, derived from data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite on 1 April 2021, shows the Sulphur Dioxide emitted by the Etna volcano in the evening of 31 March. The atmospheric SO2 visible in this image was emitted during the 17th paroxysm of Etna in only 45 days. Unlike previous episodes, in which the volcanic cloud drifted towards the east, on 1 April winds pushed the eruptive column southwards. The plume reached a height of about 7,000 metres above sea level, but had no impact on air traffic at the Catania airport. The monitoring of SO2 emissions is critical as it can affect human health, while volcanic ash is a serious hazard for aviation. The data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite is one of the most advanced resources for worldwide SO2 monitoring on a daily basis."
"summer-snow-over-western-and-central-alps"	"In the very first days of August, a low pressure area, associated with a cold air front brought some summer snow on the Alps, generally above an altitude of 2500m. In the Italian Alps for example, 35 cm of fresh snow were reported at the Stelvio Pass (2700 m ASL) on 4 August and even Austria had some snow over its mountains. Summer snow in altitude is not unusual and can help to replenish the slopes on glaciers open for skiing. This natural colour image, acquired on 5 August 2020 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, shows a large part of the Alps under clear skies, and very visible pristine snow. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission, which is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, is equipped with the OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Instrument) instrument that provides multispectral data with 21 different spectral bands and a daily revisit time. Using the OLCI spectral measurements it is possible to design specific algorithms to extract important snow properties such as snow specific surface area, snow extent and grain size, with a spatial resolution of 300m."
"summer-view-alaska-north-slope-us"	"As a consequence of the global rise in temperatures, Earth's northern landscapes are changing. In particular, the Arctic tundra, one of the coldest biomes on Earth, is changing rapidly due to Climate Change. A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that the Arctic regions have become greener as warmer air and soil temperatures lead to increased plant growth. The study concludes that the greening impacts not only the wildlife that depends on certain plants but also the people who live in the Arctic regions and depend on local ecosystems for food. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 July 2020, shows the status of the vegetation of Alaska’s North Slope Region in the US, one of the areas where the greening is more pronounced. Copernicus satellite data is key for monitoring the impact of climate change on Arctic vegetation."
"sundarbans-national-park"	"Mangroves are amongst the most biologically important ecosystems on the planet. They act as critical habitats for fish stocks and are important carbon stores. As salt-tolerant trees, they are adapted to life in difficult coastal conditions and play a crucial role during storms and floods as they protect coastal communities and natural habitats from severe impacts. Despite their resistance to extreme conditions, mangrove ecosystems are at risk of up completely submerging below the seas in a matter of few decades due to forecasted rising sea levels brought about by climate change. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellites on the March 2020. It shows Sundarbans National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997, is the largest mangrove ecosystem in the world. Copernicus Sentinel missions are suitable for mapping and monitoring the extent of mangroves in different ecosystems and for determining their richness in species"

Hinnamnor is the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season. Its strength has been determined to be equivalent to a Category 5 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. According to the latest forecasts, Hinnamnor could impact the Korean Peninsula or southwest Japan in early September. Data derived from images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission enable improvements in the scientific understanding of the composition of the atmosphere and extreme weather events."
"super-typhoon-nanmadol"	"Super typhoon Nanmadol hits the southern tip of Japan. Nanmadol is one of the biggest storms to hit the Japanese islands in recent years. On 18 September, the day on which this image from one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites was acquired, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a warning for strong winds and waves “never experienced before”, and 4 million people were evacuated. Despite this, two fatalities and major transport disruptions were reported. The data derived from the images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 provide useful information for climate studies and weather forecasts."
"sustainable-future-marceddi-lagoon"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 June 2023, shows the Marceddì Lagoon, a Natura 2000 site in Sardegna, Italy. The Lagoon, which is a Mediterranean ecological paradise, is in danger, as significant parts of the area could be submerged by 2100 due to climate change. To protect this biodiverse haven, the MEDSEA Foundation is implementing the TransformAR project, an initiative that aims to develop and demonstrate innovative solutions for rapid and far-reaching adaptation to climate change. Copernicus Sentinel Open Data contribute to the continuous monitoring of Natura 2000 sites."
"sustainable-transformation-tonga-archipelago"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 5 August 2021, shows the islands of Tongatapu and ‘Eua in the Tonga archipelago. The Tonga archipelago is particularly susceptible to a wide range of environmental threats which are exacerbated by climate change, including extreme weather events, coastal erosion, heat waves, droughts, ocean acidification and sea level rise. As part of a sustainable transformation drive, locals have recently started building canoes instead of motor boats, reducing their environmental impact and helping to preserve marine biodiversity. The Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite is making it possible to monitor the effects of climate change on the oceans, and in particular to study rising sea-levels on an unprecedented scale."
"sweden-kebnekaise-mountain"	"This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 26 June 2022, shows the Kebnekaise Mountain, the highest mountain in Sweden.

The entire massif is heavily glaciated, and the height of the two highest points varies from year to year."
"swirls-black-sea"	"The Black Sea is located between Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Western Asia. It is supplied by many major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Southern Bug, Dniester, Don, and the Rioni. The watersheds of many countries drain into the Black Sea beyond the six that immediately border it. This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite on the 12 May 2020, shows the south-eastern coast of the Black Sea beautifully decorated with fantastic swirls and eddies. This phenomenon is caused by the mixing of turbid and sediment-rich waters pouring into the sea from the various confluent rivers. The twin Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, with their daily revisit period, help monitor water quality and sedimentary processes of water bodies thanks to the 21 frequency bands of their Ocean and Land Colour Instrument ( OLCI)."
"swirls-great-slave-lake"	"In June 2020, swirls coloured the waters of the Great Slave Lake, Canada – the world’s tenth largest lake by area and the deepest lake in North America. Between 19 and 21 June 2020, the Copernicus Sentinel-2A satellite captured these stunning swirls. In this image, we see swirls at both the northern and southern ends of the lake. And, they are caused by very different natural phenomena. In the southern coastal areas, the thaw of the Hay river transports and discharges sediments into the lake disrupting the waters. While the northern swirls are caused by a phytoplankton bloom. The swirls range in colour and include light browns, light greens, blues and whites. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites orbit the Earth acquiring measurements and imagery using onboard sensors, some of which are particularly suited to study and monitor water quality and pollution."
"swirls-netherlands"	"In the first days of April, northern Europe witnessed splendid cloudless days caused by prolonged anticyclonic conditions. Such conditions were particularly suitable for observing the waters of the North Sea. This image acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite shows magnificent swirls caused by the shuffling of suspended sediments and sandbanks off the north coast of the Netherlands, a phenomenon typical at this time of year, but rare to capture in such detail. The combined use of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites allows to study the ocean and land surface to harvest information related to biology (e.g. phenology (that’s seasonal change) of marine and terrestrial biomass); the Sentinel-3 OLCI instruments (Ocean and Land Colour Imager) also provide reliable information on the atmosphere, especially on the characterisation of aerosols."
"swiss-cities-will-not-be-spared-climate-change"	"This 3D rendering of an image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 August 2022, shows the area around Lugano in Switzerland.

The knowledge centre on Earth observation (KCEO) helps EU policymakers to fully exploit Copernicus data to make informed decisions in line with the EU biodiversity strategy."
"tankers-paths-cross-arctic-northern-sea-route-without-icebreaker-escort"	"For years, the northern area of the Arctic Ocean off the Eastern Siberian coast of Russia has been considered one of the hardest to reach places in the Northern Hemisphere and one of the most inhospitable tracts on the Northern Sea Route. However, in the night of 11 January 2021, two icebreaking liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, the Christophe de Margerie and Nikolay Zubov, crossed paths in the Northern Arctic Ocean, taking advantage of the reduced thickness of the ice. This marks the first time that two tankers sail (in opposite directions) the North Sea route, without icebreaker escort in January. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 13 January 2021, shows the path of one of the two LNG, breaking the sea ice of the Arctic ocean. Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites provide useful of information about the development of ice conditions in the Arctic. For instance, the provision of data on sea ice help to improve ship routing services, offshore operations and search and rescue operations, thus contributing to marine safety."
"tarpum-bay-bahamas"	"Sometimes, ocean waves carve underwater sand dunes creating amazing works of art. Once such place on our beautiful planet that this happens is in the Bahamas, where the dunes are born from the erosion of limestone coral reefs. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 May 2020, shows the carbonate sand dunes in the shallow waters of Tarpum Bay, southwest of Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas. Built essentially as a land monitoring mission, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites now find themselves very useful for a multitude of marine applications such as coastal water monitoring, marine debris detection and coral reef monitoring. Data from these missions is used by scientists worldwide."

This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change-induced temperature rises. According to a new study published in the prestigious scientific journal Reviews of Geophysics, this area is warming at a rate almost double of the global average, and in the future, the air temperatures could rise by up to 5°C with respect to the reference data. Every month the Copernicus Climate Change Service issues detailed bulletins on the state of temperature anomalies around the world. They can be consulted here."
"thawing-permafrost-chersky-russian-arctic"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 October 2021, shows the town of Chersky in the far north of Siberia. Chersky is a small town located a few kilometres from the Arctic Ocean, where temperatures often fall below -40°C in winter. The Northeast Science Station has been monitoring the permafrost on which the town was founded for over 30 years. According to Sergey Zimov, director of the observatory, the permafrost around Chersky will completely thaw due to climate change. With his team, Zimov is studying the effects of introducing populations of herbivores into the Arctic tundra, as their pasturing could combat the accelerated thawing of the permafrost. Data from the Copernicus satellites allow the effects of climate change in the Arctic regions to be monitored with high accuracy and frequency."
"thawing-permafrost-norilsk-russia"	"This image, taken on 13 October 2021, shows the city of Norilsk on the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia. Norilsk is the most populous city in the Russian Arctic. In recent years, the city has endured the effects of climate change, particularly thawing permafrost. This phenomenon not only resulted in the worst oil spill in the history of the Arctic, but several buildings in Norilsk are showing cracks in their foundations due to shifts in ground stability. This has prompted the authorities to invest around 8 million euros to cool the foundations of the buildings in order to slow the effects of thawing. The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly pronounced, requiring accurate and science-based data and information to address them. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) aims to support European climate policies and actions, contributing to building a society which is more resilient to a human-induced changing climate."
"thawing-yukon-river-delta-alaska"	"This false-colour image, obtained from data acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 15 May 2021, shows the Yukon River Delta in the US state of Alaska in the first phase of spring thaw. The delta includes extensive wetlands that are protected in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, the second largest wildlife refuge in the United States. The thaw in this area generally starts in the last weeks of April. In this image, the tundra, which is no longer snow-covered, is shown in tones of red, while the large blue areas show remnants of sea ice in the Bering Sea. The Yukon Delta is vulnerable to climate change. Due to thawing permafrost and an increase in the duration of the fire season, the landscape of this region is changing rapidly, putting the biodiversity of the area at risk. Free and open data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are used to monitor the health of fragile ecosystems such as the Arctic tundra."
"thousands-relocated-india-and-pakistan-cyclone-biparjoy-draws-near"	"This image, acquired by one of Copernicus’ Sentinel-3 satellites, shows Cyclone Biparjoy, which is expected to make landfall in India’s Gujarat state. As the cyclone gathers strength, emergency measures are being promptly implemented. In India, local authorities organised the evacuation of thousands of residents of the coastal areas deemed most vulnerable to the cyclone's potential impact. Similarly, Pakistan's authorities took steps to safeguard citizens by relocating numerous individuals away from the coast. The data derived from the images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 provides vital information on extreme weather events as they develop, guiding authorities and helping to saving lives."
"three-gorges-dam"	"Severe floods hit China, leaving at least 150 people dead between June and the first week of July 2020. Unusually intense rainfall swept away buildings and destroyed homes in southern provinces, affecting about 15 million residents. Rains in the Yangtze River basin were particularly intense and the Three Gorges Dam, located along the Yangtze River, reached its peak capacity on 2 July, luckily, without reaching its full storage capacity. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 July, shows the Three Gorges Dam discharge still present an entire week after the peak of the Yangtze River flow. Data obtained by the Copernicus Sentinel satellite missions allows us to monitor, with very high precision, the quality and volume of water contained within dams, as well as make assessments of the structural stability of these dams."
"tierra-del-fuego"	"Tierra del Fuego is a group of islands belonging to Argentina and Chile, located in the southernmost part of the American continent. Its climate is heavily influenced by its proximity to Antarctica, which is distant only a few hundred kilometres. The frequent weather storms coming from the Antarctic ocean make the area almost perpetually covered by clouds. It was not the case on 12 November when one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured this cloudless view of the entire archipelago. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission consists of twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, which both carry the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) among their instruments. One of the main applications of the OLCI is related to monitoring the atmosphere, including the ability to derive the illumination conditions of the observed area or to measure the solar radiation descending to the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere."
"tilos-island-aegean-sea-greece"	"This image, acquired on 13 March 2021 by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the Greek island of Tilos. Until a few years ago, most of the residential electricity consumption on the small Greek island of Tilos was supplied by a submarine cable connecting it to a diesel power plant on the larger Kos island, almost 50 km northeast. In 2017, a project was launched to transform Tilos into a wildlife conservation area. It included the installation of a hybrid energy system consisting of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic power plant and two high-energy-density batteries. Today the power plant supplies 75% of the island’s energy needs in the summer, when its population reaches more than one thousand people, while it produces a surplus of energy in the winter, when population halves. The green conversion of Tilos was made possible thanks to the TILOS project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The island has become the first island in Southern Europe to achieve almost complete independence from electricity generated from fossil fuels. The success of the TILOS project paved the way for similar projects that reflect the objectives of the European Green Deal, by which the EU aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 through the reduction of energy consumption and a strong push towards clean energy production. Open data provided by the Copernicus Climate Change and services support the energy sector by providing historical data, seasonal forecasts and projections for climate, electricity demand and the production of power, from wind, solar and hydro, at regional and national levels throughout Europe. The Atmosphere Monitoring delivers short term forecasts on solar radiation and aerosol that help in predicting the efficiency of solar power plants and in their day-to-day operations."
"timahdite-moroccan-mountain-village-trapped-snow"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 December 2021, shows the snow-covered Atlas mountains of Morocco – the highest mountain range in North Africa. It is not uncommon to observe snow-covered areas in North Africa. Snowfall can at times make roads impassable and villages can sometimes be isolated for days. This is what recently occurred in Timahdite, a Moroccan village located in the Middle Atlas mountain range in early December, following the arrival of cold air which originated in the Arctic. The data captured by the twin Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites are particularly suitable for observing high-altitude mountain systems, mapping snow cover, and monitoring vulnerable communities around the world."

"tromso-norway"	"Tromsø is a city located on the banks of the Tromsøfjord, (county of Troms and Finnmark in Norway), about 350 km north of the Arctic Circle (66 ° 33 '39 "" of latitude). Because of its geographical location, the city is considered to be the gateway to the North Pole. In Tromsø, between 21 May and 23 July, one can experience the “midnight sun” during which the sun never drops below the horizon and, consequently, the night never falls. This only occurs in the northern hemisphere, in areas above the Arctic Circle. From 23 November to 18 January inclusive, the opposite happens - the sun does not rise above the horizon. The latter period is particularly favorable for observing the Aurora or Northern Lights. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 May, shows part of the county of Troms and Finnmark still completely covered by snow. The joint use of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites allows monitoring the ice thickness and the surface velocity of glaciers in the mainland of Norway and around the world. This data allows scientists to improve the predictions of sea-level variations on a global scale."
"tropical-cyclone-freddy"	"On 19 February at 05:00 UTC, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites acquired this image of Freddy, a very intense tropical cyclone currently active in the Indian Ocean. The storm is expected to approach Mauritius Island and La Réunion on 20 February before hitting the coast of Madagascar on 21 February, bringing along strong winds, heavy rainfall, and the potential for flash floods and landslides. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service has been activated as a preventive measure. Further details will be available here."
"tropical-cyclone-freddy-remains-active-indian-ocean"	"At the end of February, tropical cyclone Freddy caused significant damage and population displacements in Madagascar and Mozambique, with at least 21 casualties. After more than two weeks, its cyclonic activity has not stopped. As shown in this image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites, on 7 March, Freddy was approaching Madagascar for the second time. The storm, which developed off the coast of northern Australia and crossed the entire South Indian Ocean, has been described as ""remarkable"" by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) due to its potentially record-breaking (in terms of duration) journey across the ocean and its high accumulated cyclonic energy. The WMO is looking into the statistics to confirm that Freddy is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone since records are kept. Copernicus satellite data can be used to monitor the damages caused by extreme weather events."
"tropical-cyclone-freddy-strikes-africa-second-time"	"Tropical cyclone Freddy, during its extensive journey, has caused serious destruction and loss of life. The latest countries to be devastated by the cyclone are Mozambique and Malawi, with more than 300 fatalities and dozens of missing persons.

The striking colours of the fields show their beauty in spring, from April to mid-May, attracting more than one million tourists each year."
"tulips-bloom"	"The symbolic flowers of Netherlands are tulips: these flowers are characteristic of the country thanks to a particular combination of climate and soil, the polders. Dutch tulip fields come into bloom every year during April and it is possible to admire the variety of colours using satellite images. Blooming fields near Lisse are visible in this image acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 14 April. With a revisit time of five days, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver information about the growing status of vegetation."
"tulips-bloom-netherland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 20 May 2021, shows the spring tulip bloom in the north of the Netherlands. Thanks to the combination of a rather cool spring climate and of the soil composition and physical characteristics of the polders, the Netherlands enjoy ideal conditions for growing tulip bulbs. The area shown in this Sentinel-2 image is the region of Kop van Noord-Holland, the largest tulip-growing area in the Netherlands. With a revisit time of five days, Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide information on the state of vegetation growth."
"tulips-bloom-netherlands"	"As spring arrives, the mesmerising tulip fields of the Netherlands burst into full bloom, adorning the European landscape with an impressive array of vibrant colours. This image, acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 30 April, shows the breathtaking beauty of the blooming fields near Julianadorp, a picturesque village located in the province of North Holland known for its flowering fields. The image catches just the tulips' hues of red, yellow and pink, which create a kaleidoscope of colours visible from space. Copernicus plays a crucial role in agriculture by providing valuable crop monitoring and management data, such as identification of optimal planting times and tracking plant health, ultimately enhancing productivity and sustainability."
"tunisias-wetlands-threatened-effects-climate-change"	"The lakes and coastal lagoons of Tunisia are currently grappling with the dire and far-reaching consequences brought about by extreme temperatures and prolonged drought. This situation has led to a significant disruption in the delicate balance of these ecosystems. The drying up of the Ariana Lagoon, located near Tunis and recognised as an important nesting site for migratory birds, vividly illustrates this ongoing crisis. Once vibrant with life, the lagoon is now barren and desolate, as shown when comparing images captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites in August 2021 (on the left) and 2023 (on the right). The Copernicus Emergency Management Service runs the Global Drought Observatory, which has published a report on the long-lasting and extensive drought in North Africa."
"typhoon-fa-philippine-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 21 July 2021 at 01:54 UTC, shows Typhoon In-Fa south of the Ryukyu Islands in Japan. In-Fa is the third typhoon to form in the Philippine Sea in 2021. According to forecasts by the Japanese Meteorological Agency, it will reach the island of Taiwan in the coming days, affecting the capital Taipei. Powerful typhoons regularly occur during the summer in the Philippine Sea, although they can form throughout the year due to the warm temperature of waters of in the Pacific Ocean. Thus, unlike the Atlantic hurricane season, the typhoon season in the western Pacific has no defined beginning or end. Data derived from images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission enable improvements in scientific understanding of the atmosphere's composition and provide essential information for climate studies and weather forecasts."
"typhoon-goni-philippines"	"Typhoon Goni, Asia's most powerful typhoon this year, has made landfall in the Philippines with maximum sustained winds of 225km/h (140mph). The state weather service said the typhoon hit Catanduanes island on Sunday at 04:50 local time (19:50 GMT Saturday). It has since crossed onto the main island of Luzon, where the capital Manila is located. Almost a million people have been evacuated from their homes. Catastrophic winds and intense to torrential rainfall are forecasted according to weather and disaster management officials. The storm is expected to cross over Luzon south of Manila and continue into the South China Sea on Sunday afternoon. Goni - known as Rolly in the Philippines - is the most powerful storm to hit the Philippines since Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,000 people in 2013. This image is a false colour combination of radar images captured by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 31 October 2020 at 21:30 UTC. It shows the eye of the typhoon while making landfall in the island of Catanduanes. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) which are equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) that provide continuous all-weather, day-and-night imagery for multiple applications. In particular, new techniques have been developed allowing the radar to measure sea-surface wind and wave heights. This information about the sea state can help to assess how destructive hurricanes and typhoons are and predict their path – and, therefore, where and when they are likely to make landfall.The same data can also be used to alert ships and to issue warnings for coastal flooding."
"typhoon-khanun"	"Typhoon Khanun is the sixth typhoon of the season in the Pacific and has been classified as being of ""very strong"" intensity. The extreme weather event caused the suspension of flights from the city of Naha, knocking out power for more than 200,000 people and causing the evacuation of 600,000 residents. The Okinawa archipelago remains on a weather alert for flood and landslide risks until the end of August. On 2 August, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites captured this image of the eye of the typhoon which is approaching Okinawa with speeds of up to 220 km/h. Copernicus Sentinel satellites provide free and open data that allow the monitoring of hurricanes and typhoons on a global scale."
"typhoon-lan"	"This image, captured by a Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite on 11 August at 00:39 UTC, shows Typhoon Lan, currently located to the east of Japan's Ogasawara Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Typhoon Lan has reached peak wind speeds of 126 kilometres per hour. It should be making landfall over the larger Japanese islands on 15 August, with forecasts from NOAA predicting a weakening of its intensity. Data from images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite mission improve our understanding atmospheric composition and dynamics, and provide crucial inputs for climate research and weather forecasting."
"typhoon-noru-makes-landfall-vietnam"	"After sweeping through the Philippines, where it destroyed buildings and infrastructure, Typhoon Noru hit Vietnam, making landfall near the city of Da Nang on 28 September 2022. Classified as a category 4, Noru is the strongest typhoon on record to have reached the country, causing significant damage and the evacuation of about 400,000 people as of Tuesday 27 September. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 27 September 2022, shows the typhoon before it made landfall. The data derived from the images acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-3 provide useful information for climate studies and weather forecasts."
"typhoon-surigae-bising-pacific-ocean"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 22 April 2021 at 01:44 UTC, shows Typhoon Surigae (known as Typhoon Bising in the Philippines) in the Pacific Ocean, hovering between the Philippines and Taiwan. Surigae is the first typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season. Its strength has been determined to be equivalent to a Category 5 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, and it took the typhoon only 36 hours to reach maximum winds of 305 km/h and a minimum barometric pressure of 888 hPa, an extremely low value for a tropical system. Surigae has become the most intense typhoon ever recorded in the month of April and the first tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere to reach a barometric pressure below 900 hPa before the first of May, beating the previous record of 935 hPa, set by Typhoon Maysak in 2015. Data derived from images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission enable improvements in the scientific understanding of the composition of the atmosphere and provide essential information for climate studies and weather forecasting."
"tyuleniy-archipelago-caspian-sea"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 January 2021, shows the sea ice that surrounds the Tyuleniy Archipelago in the Caspian Sea. Despite its relatively low latitude, the sea surface around the archipelago is covered in sea ice every winter. Due to its location leaving it vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the area covered in sea ice is decreasing year after year, both in extension and temporal duration. In spring, the Tyuleniy Archipelago becomes a biodiversity hotspot: it has been recognised as an Important Bird Area of Kazakhstan and a National Protected Zone (State Reservation) because of the large concentrations of seagulls and wetland birds, such as coots, wild ducks, swans, egrets and waders that inhabit it during their nesting period. The Copernicus Sentinel missions provide high frequency data useful for monitoring ecosystems and their response to climate change."
"ukraine-syvash"	"The Syvash is an area of shallow lagoons on the west coast of the Sea of Azov, in Ukraine. The deepest lagoon is 3 metres deep, while most areas are 1.5 m deep. During summer the water level decreases, leaving barren soil and a putrid smell. Because of the high concentration of salt, a salt-tolerant micro-alga accumulates, forming a red patina on the surface of the lagoons. This image was acquired by a Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite on 18 October 2022."
"unesco-designates-dromling-germany-biosphere-reserve"	"This image, captured by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 June 2023, shows the Drömling Biosphere Reserve, one of the 11 new biosphere reserves recently designated by UNESCO. Located on both sides of the border between Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony, this reserve is a vibrant mosaic of ecosystems shaped by centuries of human activity and meticulous nature conservation efforts. Around 54% of the biosphere reserve's area is designated as a bird sanctuary by the European network of protected areas (Natura 2000). The use of data from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites, combined with in situ data, is proving to be instrumental in monitoring protected areas and preserving their biodiversity."
"unesco-global-geoparks-network-welcomes-new-sites-including-lavreotiki"	"The UNESCO Executive Board has recently approved the inclusion of 18 new sites into the UNESCO Global Geoparks network, expanding the total count to 195 geoparks across 48 different countries. Among the newly added geoparks is the Lavreotiki UNESCO Global Geopark in Greece. The site, with a total area of 177 square kilometres, is renowned for its rich assortment and diversity of mineral specimens, many of which were initially discovered in the area. The Lavreotiki Geopark is visible in this is 3D rendering of an image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 25 May 2023. Copernicus supports the management of geoparks by providing data on land cover, land use and enabling the monitoring of key environmental variables, such as air quality."
"unprecedented-fires-threaten-giant-sequoia-forests-california"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 22 November 2021, shows the burn scar caused by the KNP Complex wildfire in the Sierra Nevada, California. The KNP Complex wildfire burned about 35,000 hectares, devastating the Sequoia National Park and Sequoia National Forest. According to local authorities, more than 2,200 giant sequoias, a tree that only grows in this part of California, were burned in the fire. The KNP Complex Fire is the manifestation of a trend of abnormally powerful wildfires that are affecting the region. Local authorities also noted that about a third of the total population of giant sequoias growing in the area burned as a consequence of wildfires in 2020 and 2021. Data from the Copernicus missions allow the monitoring of wildfires around the world."
"unprecedented-melting-svalbard-ice-cap"	"The Svalbard archipelago is suffering from an unprecedented episode of ice cap melting caused by the high temperatures that persist since the early summer in this area of the Arctic Circle. According to the Laboratory of Climatology and Topoclimatology of the Liege University, between June and August 2022, the temperature anomaly at Svalbard was between 2 and 3°C and the ice mass balance, or Surface Mass Balance (SMB), was strongly negative. The cumulative SMB value during this summer reached about 400mm, an unprecedented and anomalous value, about five times higher than the reference values. These images, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, allow to compare the status of the ice cap of the Edgeøya Island, in the south of the archipelago, on 28 August 2021 (image on the left) and 20 August 2022 (image on the right). The image allows to observe that in 2022 the snow/ice cover completely disappeared, while the oldest layers of the ice cap were exposed to sunlight and were subject to a rapid melting phenomenon."
"unprecedented-smoke-cloud-over-us-west-coast-and-pacific-ocean"	"The United States are battling with unprecedented wildfires, fueled by heatwaves and windy conditions. More than three weeks after the start of the current wildfire episode, the states of Washington, Oregon and California are devastated. According to the US National Interagency Fire Center, there are 102 ongoing large fires in the western US and more than 4.4 million acres have burned so far. The intensity of the fires is producing unheard of amounts of smoke along the West Coast. This visualisation, derived from the data acquired by the Tropomi instrument onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite on 10 September 2020, shows the smoke cloud covering Washington State, Oregon and California and large areas over the Pacific Ocean. The approximate total area of the blanket of smoke is 4.5 million km2. The insert shows that smoke from US wildfires has reached Norway, after a journey of about 8,000 km. With a revisit time of one day, the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite delivers free and open access data that can be used to monitor air quality worldwide, and this data can feed models that predict the impact of aerosol storms."
"unprecedented-weather-extremes-devastate-mediterranean-region"	"The Mediterranean region is enduring a severe heatwave, resulting in a series of extreme weather events that have left behind a trail of devastation. On 24 July, temperatures reached unprecedented heights, breaking records in multiple cities. In Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, the air temperature soared to a sweltering 49°C, while in Palermo, Sicily (Italy), the thermometer peaked at 47°C, significantly surpassing its previous all-time heat record set in 1791 by a staggering 2°C. In addition to the heatwave, the Mediterranean Basin is also grappling with severe wildfires. On the same day, one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites captured a massive smoke plume generated by the ongoing wildfires in North Africa. Algeria, in particular, has been hit hard by the wildfires which have claimed the lives of 34 people. Neighbouring Tunisia has also been affected, with one significant blaze ravaging the border town of Melloula and prompting the evacuation of at least 300 residents."
"unseasonal-fire-far-east-siberia-november-2021"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 3 November 2021, shows a fire in progress near the town of Arman’, in the Magadan region in the Far East of Siberia. This unseasonal fire, likely started by lightning, is proving difficult for firefighters to contain. At this time of year, the air temperature in Arman’ falls to about 20 degrees below zero. Counterintuitively, this makes putting out the fire more difficult as almost all of the water in the area, which could be used to combat the fire, has frozen. The fire is also fuelled by strong winds, whilst the absence of snow, often present in the Magadan region in November, has allowed the flames to spread more easily. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission enables the deployment of applications for detecting and monitoring fires, as well as mapping burnt areas, with a spatial resolution of 10 metres."
"unseasonal-high-temperatures-greenland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 March 2023, shows the capital of Greenland, Nuuk. An intense heatwave is ongoing in this region of the island, with air temperatures more than 20 degrees above the historical average for this time of year. On the same day that this image was acquired, the temperature in Nuuk reached a record of 15.1°C, which is the highest ever recorded in March in this area of Greenland. The Copernicus Sentinels satellite missions play an important role in monitoring the impact of climate change in remote areas such as the Arctic."
"unseasonal-peat-fire-russia"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 14 October 2021, shows the smoke generated by a peat fire near Yekaterinburg in Russia. Since the second week of October, violent fires have been raging in the peat bogs near the largest city in the Urals. Although firefighters are working to put out the fires, smoke has filled the skies. As a result, several roads have been closed due to poor visibility and several commercial flights have been diverted to nearby airports. Peat fires are common in this part of Russia but are unusual at this time of year. With active peat fires so late in the autumn, the 2021 fire season is one of the longest in recorded history, according to media reports. Data from Copernicus satellite missions allow for high-definition spatial monitoring of fires in progress around the world."
"unseasonal-saharan-dust-storm-atlantic-ocean"	"A massive and unseasonal Saharan dust storm is ongoing in the Atlantic Ocean. The dust has deteriorated the air quality in the Iberian Peninsula and, as shown in this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image acquired on 3 October 2022, the dust cloud is engulfing the skies of Gran Canaria, La Gomera and Tenerife in the Canary islands. The forecasting of these events is important because the suspended dust causes air quality to worsen significantly. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides forecasts to help policymakers, citizens and other stakeholders plan to mitigate the negative effects of dust storms and has closely monitored the latest dust storm episodes."
"unusual-atmospheric-configuration-over-europe"	"An unusual weather pattern is currently prevailing over Europe. It was responsible, inter alia, for the presence of suspended Saharan dust in the Iberian Peninsula over the past few days, and has now caused the dust to move further north, reaching the Scandinavian Peninsula. As a consequence of this unusual weather configuration, higher than average temperatures and rainfall have been registered over the Arctic Circle, mercury has reached 5°C along the Norwegian fjords, while it is snowing in Republic of Türkiye. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 17 March 2022, shows the uncommon shape of the storm which passed over Switzerland, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden."
"unusual-gain-ice-and-snow-mass-greenland-ice-sheet"	"This image, acquired by one of the two Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 9 July 2021, shows the Kangerlussuaq Fjord in Greenland. The Kangerlussuaq Fjord is one of the largest fjords on the island. Usually, in July and August, there are massive floods in the area due to the summer thawing of the snow and ice sheet. In 2021, however, according to the Danish Arctic Research Institutions (Polar Portal), the Greenland ice sheet is unusually gaining ice and snow mass. Researchers attribute this positive anomaly to a consequence of the heat dome looming over Canada. The warm air confines the cold Arctic air masses over the north-eastern part of Greenland, inducing colder than average temperatures and a consequential accumulation of ice and snow. Open data from Copernicus services and satellites enable to study of the effects of climate change in polar regions."
"unusually-low-sea-ice-extent-svalbard-archipelago-norway"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 March 2021, shows the town of Longyearbyen, the most populous settlement of Norway’s Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. The sea ice in this area reaches its maximal annual extent every year in March — in 2021, this maximal extent equalled 14.77 million km², and it was reached on 21 March. According to NASA, it is the seventh-lowest maximal extent of Arctic sea ice ever recorded. The Norwegian Ice Service has also reported that the extent of the sea ice in Svalbard on 31 March 2021, only five days after this Copernicus Sentinel-2 image was acquired, amounted to the second-lowest area ever recorded for this day of the year. Timely measurements of the sea ice extent over large areas and at high spatial and temporal resolutions are essential for its monitoring. The Norwegian Ice Service uses data from the Copernicus Sentinel missions for its sea ice monitoring activities in the Arctic Ocean."
"uttarakhand-disaster-india"	"A devastating flash flood that happened on 7 February 2021 in India's northern state of Uttarakhand caused the deaths of at least 32 people, while several hundred workers of the two hydropower plants construction sites that were destroyed on the rivers Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga are reported missing. The Chamoli district has suffered the brunt of the flood, with massive infrastructural damage, loss of life and widespread environmental damage in the ecologically fragile area of Uttarakhand that lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range. Relief efforts are still underway, with emergency crews attempting to rescue workers trapped in underground service tunnels and the inhabitants of nearby villages whose houses were washed away by the flood. The exact cause of the devastating flood is yet to be ascertained, but early assessments indicate that the event could have started by a landslide that caused a large avalanche of ice and rock between two remote glacier peaks, Raunthi and Mrigthuni, both at above 5,500 metres of elevation. The role of climate change and climate-related factors has not yet been confirmed, but what is clear is that this was not the first recorded avalanche in this region, as a similar but smaller event was recorded in 2016. This image, which has been acquired by one of the two satellites of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows a wide three-dimensional view of the zone most affected by the massive flood. The red arrow on the left shows the possible point of origin of the landslide, and the insert on the right is a magnified view of the sites of the two hydropower plants in construction that were destroyed, the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Project (TVHPP) and the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project (RGHEP). The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission is composed of two twin satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) that provide multispectral data at a maximum spatial resolution of ten metres. Its high-resolution open data allow us to develop an accurate understanding of the extent of the flood and contribute to damage assessment in the affected areas."
"valencia-european-green-capital-2024"	"Last week, the winners of the European Green Capital and Leaf 2024 Awards were announced in Grenoble, France, which had won this year’s European Green Capital title. At the ceremony, the Spanish city of Valencia was crowned the 2024 European Green Capital, thanks to its successful promotion of sustainable tourism and achievements in the fields of climate neutrality and inclusive green transition. The city is visible in this image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 2 October 2022. Open data from Copernicus Sentinel satellites can be used to monitor key parameters useful for the design and implementation of urban policies in cities around the world."
"vanuatu-declares-state-climate-emergency"	"Vanuatu is a volcanic archipelago in the Pacific Ocean consisting of more than 80 relatively small islands of volcanic origin. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 28 May 2022, shows the central islands of the archipelago, including the Ambrym volcano. On 27 May 2022, Vanatu’s parliament in Port Vila, its capital, declared a State of Climate Emergency. In his speech, the nation’s prime minister has reported that climate change is expected to have an impact on the local territory amounting to an estimated 1.2 billion dollars, emphasising the necessity to take urgent action. Moreover, he highlighted that rising sea levels and severe weather events – such as devastating cyclones – are already affecting the Pacific Ocean and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future because of climate change. Copernicus Sentinel satellites and thematic services provide crucial data to better understand and monitor climate change, and to develop mitigation and adaptation measures."
"vatnajokull-national-park-iceland"	"Vatnajökull National Park is a national park in Iceland, registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2019. It encompasses all of the Vatnajökull glacier, the largest European glacier outside the arctic circle. Under the glacier, eight volcanoes are present among which Bárðarbunga is the largest and Grímsvötn the most active. One of the features that make the park unique are the black streaks visible along the slopes of the glaciers: they are caused by layers of ash deposited on the glacier during the previous eruptions of Icelandic volcanoes. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 26 August 2020, shows a very rare completely cloudless view of the Vatnajökull National Park. Thanks to the very high acquisition frequency, the data derived from Sentinel-2 are the basis of the most recent studies on glaciers and volcano monitoring."
"vehicles-flames-after-fuel-tanker-exploded-afghanistan-iran-border"	"On 13 February 2021, a gas-carrying truck exploded in Islam Qala, in Afghanistan's western province of Herat, at a border post with Iran. It is still not known what caused the tanker to explode and set fire to more than 100 other nearby fuel tankers. A total of 500 vehicles ended up being destroyed by flames, while at least 60 people were injured, and power supply was disrupted. Local authorities estimate that the incident caused 50 millions of dollars in damages. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 on 14 February 2021, shows that, one day after the explosion, the fires (red hot spots) continued to burn. With a revisit time of 5 days on average at the equator, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites deliver free and open data that can be used to monitor human activities around the world."
"venice-lagoon-italy"	"When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the COVID-19 infection in March 2020, regular urban water traffic in the Venice lagoon stopped completely. This allowed us to observe the lagoon waters in a non-disturb state, and without the turbidity caused by sustained maritime traffic. The confinement in Italy ended at the very start of June 2020 and recreational activities restarted immediately. The two images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2A satellites compare the state of the lagoon on 13 April 2020 and 2 June 2020 and the presence of boats is evident in the second image. The waters of the lagoon are dynamic, what looks like the lagoon floor is in fact cloudy water, caused by the traffic travelling through these waters and disturbing and suspending particles within the water. Different algorithms using visible and near infrared bands, were applied for the estimation of water turbidity: data derived by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly suitable to monitor chlorophylls, turbidity and suspended solids in shallow waters."
"viedma-glacier-argentina"	"The Viedma glacier is the second largest glacier in the Andes and the largest glacier in Argentina. It is also one of the most dynamic in the Southern Patagonian Icefield, and is, unfortunately, particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. Scientists estimate that, due to rising temperatures, the Viedma glacier has lost between 10-20% of its total surface area. Seasonal calving can be observed in this image, acquired on 13 November 2021 by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, with ice separating from the glacier at its terminus point and floating in the Viedma Lake. Meltwater from retreating glaciers such as the Viedma Glacier contributes to rising sea levels. In 2020, the Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite was launched into orbit with the mission of accurately measuring the height of the sea surface until at least 2030. The open data it delivers will expand our knowledge and understanding of sea level rise as a consequence of climate change."
"villarrica-volcano-chile"	"Villarrica is one of the most active volcanoes in Chile and one of the few permanently active volcanoes in the world, with frequent strombolian activity and sometimes a small lava lake in its summit crater. On 25 September 2020, an explosive event of the Villarrica volcano has been observed: it generated a small column of ash that reached a height of over 500 metres above the crater level. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites a few hours (25/09/2020 - 14:53 UTC) before the start of this volcanic activity provides a cloud-free view of the crater and of the lava lake. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) play an important role in monitoring volcanic activity: the high spatial resolution and an average revisit time of five days to monitor different volcanic processes and improve hot-spot detection techniques."
"violent-wildfires-republic-turkiye"	"This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 29 July 2021, shows multiple smoke clouds generated by the devastating wildfires ongoing in Republic of Türkiye. Violent fires broke out on 28 July in Turkish regions bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The Copernicus EMS EFFIS early warning component had forecasted very extreme fire danger for many areas of the region. One blaze affected the area of Manavgat, in the Antalya province, and was fuelled by strong winds and scorching temperatures. Another fire broke out the following night in the district of Akseki, 50 kilometres to the north. Three people died in the fires and more than 50 people had to be taken to hospital due to smoke inhalation. The smoke generated by the fires, as shown in this Sentinel-3 image, was, at the time of image acquisition, extending up to about 300 km in the Mediterranean Sea and was heading towards the south and Cyprus. Data from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites allow high-definition delineation of the areas affected by wildfires."
"volcanic-activity-etna"	"Mt Etna in Sicily, Italy, is the largest and most active volcano in Europe. Its frequent eruptions are often accompanied by large lava flows, but rarely pose a threat to inhabited areas. In August 2020 strombolian summit activity and sporadic ash emissions were observed. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 September 2020, shows the summit of Etna volcano at which hotspots (red/yellows areas) within the craters as well as a small plume from the southern craters are visible. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) plays an important role in volcanic activity monitoring thanks to the Short Wave InfraRed channels of the Multispectral Instrument carried by these two satellites. The high spatial resolution and an average revisit time of five days allow them to monitor different volcanic processes and improve hot-spot detection techniques."
"volcanic-activity-island-vulcano-italys-aeolian-archipelago"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 4 October 2021, shows the island of Vulcano in the Aeolian archipelago. The word volcano, used for geologically active mountains, is derived from the name of this island located just north of the Sicilian coast. The last observed eruption on Vulcano was in 1888. Since the beginning of September 2021, the activity of the Fossa volcano, located in the northern part of the island, has increased to a higher level than at any point in decades. Consequently, civil protection authorities have increased the level of volcanic risk and declared a yellow alert. Data from the Copernicus missions enable the monitoring of volcanoes around the world."
"volcanic-eruption-krysuvik-trolladyngja-volcanic-system-iceland"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 23 March 2021, shows the volcanic eruption ongoing in Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula. Six hundred eighty-one years after its last eruption, the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcano complex entered into an active phase in the evening hours of Friday 19 March 2021. More than 50,000 earthquakes had been recorded in the area since 24 February 2021 and experts had been anticipating a possible eruption. While the region’s skies are cloudy most of the time in this season, the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite has taken advantage of a break in the weather to capture its first high-definition image of the area where the eruption is taking place. The data from its near-infrared sensors show that, at least for the moment, the eruptive vent is of small dimensions.

"volga-river-delta"	"This image, acquired by Sentinel-3B on the 28 June 2020, shows the Volga Delta, which forms where the Volga River empties into the northwestern part of the Caspian Sea. When water from the river enters the Volga Delta, Europe’s largest inland river delta, it splits up into more than 1000 waterways. The delta is considered one of the world's most diverse river deltas because of its remarkably complex hydrographic network. It covers the seaward edge, and is composed of extensive areas of open water, numerous islands, reedbeds and other aquatic plants. The site is an important breeding ground for migratory water birds and it is also well known for the large number of sturgeons and other fish species that can be found there. For these reasons, it has been designated as a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, that allow us to monitor water quality and detect the possible presence of harmful algal blooms with their daily revisit time at a global scale."
"von-karman-vortex-cloud-swirls-canary-islands-spain"	"This Copernicus Sentinel-3 image acquired on 19 April 2021 shows several vortical cloud patterns swirling downwind south of the Spanish Canary Islands, off the coast of northwestern Africa. These beautiful spiral clouds, known as Von Kármán vortices, form when atmospheric circulation is disturbed by the presence of mountainous obstacles. The peculiar spiral clouds which can be seen in this image were formed as the wind airflow was deflected by the relief of the Canary Islands. These Von Kármán vortices can be seen extending 400 km southwest due to the strong trade winds that were blowing at the time the image was acquired. The study of atmospheric phenomena is fundamental to the understanding the fluid dynamics that underly numerous scenarios of our daily lives, from aircraft take-offs to the change in weather conditions. Open data supplied by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission are crucial in the advancement of scientific knowledge on cloud dynamics and climate analysis."

Due to the multiple heat waves that occurred during October 2021, above-average air and water temperatures were recorded in the Great Lakes' area. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Lake Superior recorded the highest ever values since the measurements began in 1995, and the other Lakes recorded temperature anomalies of about 1°C. According to Andrea Vander Woude, manager of the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, this positive water temperature anomaly could harm aquatic ecosystems in the Great Lakes. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites are particularly useful for monitoring the impact of climate change at northern latitudes."
"warming-ocean-threatens-thwaites-glacier-antarctica"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites on 29 December 2021, shows the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. This glacier is one of the largest in the world. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where Thwaites Glacier is located, has been monitored for decades. Scientists estimate that 50 billion tons of ice are released from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet every year, which contribute to a global sea level rise of 4 per cent. According to a recent study published in the Cryosphere scientific journal, warming of the Antarctic ocean could induce the melting of Thwaites Glacier’s basal structures, and consequently cause the Thwaites glacier to collapse in a few years’ time. Data acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel satellites are used to monitor the retreat of glaciers globally."
"water-colour-lake-erie"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 17 March 2021, shows swirls colouring the waters of Lake Erie, one of North America's Great Lakes. The swirls are visible in coastal areas and in deeper waters near the centre of Lake Erie. The colours ot the water, ranging from light brown, shades of light green, blue and white, are caused by the discharge of sediments from rivers and coastal areas into the lake after the winter thaw. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites orbit the Earth, capturing data and images using on-board sensors, some of which are particularly suited to studying and monitoring water quality and pollution."
"water-crisis-uruguay"	"These images, acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 29 June 2022 and 14 June 2023, show the Canelon Grande Reservoir in Montevideo, Uruguay, which is going through an unprecedented water crisis. Uruguay is facing its worst drought in decades, caused by precipitation deficits, above-average temperatures and recurrent heatwaves.

"water-deficit-lake-balaton"	"Lake Balaton is the largest lake in central Europe. Its water balance is currently at their lowest point in the last 100 years as a consequence of the ongoing drought. Copernicus Sentinel-2 image of 25 August."
"water-deficit-lake-garda"	"Drought continues to plague northern Italy, causing a severe water deficit in its reservoirs.The water level of Lake Garda, the largest Italian lake, is at its lowest level in 15 years. The insufficient rainfall deficit and the increased outflow of water to ensure the irrigation of agricultural fields in the Po Valley have caused a drastic drop in the water levels. The water level has dropped to the point that areas of the lakebed around the Sirmione peninsula, usually submerged, have emerged. The phenomenon can be observed when comparing images from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 16 August 2021 (left) and 16 August 2022 (right). The Copernicus product portfolio includes two Drought Observatories, managed by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which provide drought indicators and early warnings for droughts in Europe and worldwide."
"water-level-great-salt-lake-rises-after-record-breaking-snowfall"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 10 April, shows the Great Salt Lake in Utah, USA. The Great Salt Lake was at its lowest level ever in November 2022 as a result of months of record-breaking drought. However,thanks to a record snowpack since early 2023, the lake has risen by over one meter in just a few days. The statewide average snowpack in the area reached 76.2 cm, beating the previous record of 73.2 cm in 1952. Copernicus satellite data enables the monitoring of snow cover around the globe and contributes to hydrological monitoring by providing valuable information on the state of water resources."
"water-levels-great-salt-lake-reach-new-historic-low"	"The Great Salt Lake lies in northern Utah, in the United States, and is the largest saltwater lake in the western hemisphere. As a consequence of climate change, its water levels have significantly decreased. According to the Utah Department of Natural Resources, the Great Salt Lake has recently reached its lowest level in 170 years of data records. Its shrinking has important consequences on local biodiversity, putting migrating birds at risk, as well as impacting the local lake-based economy. The water deficit in the Great Salt Lake is visible in this image, created with a mosaic of Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite acquisitions of 4 and 7 July 2022. The Copernicus Sentinel satellites deliver key information for the monitoring of water bodies across the globe."
"water-patterns-lake-st-clair"	"This image, acquired on 19 April by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, depicts Lake Saint Clair, one of the Great Lakes of North America. During the winter months, the lake's climate is shaped by cold air masses from the Article Circle, resulting in the formation of sea ice in the lake's waters and heavy snowfall in surrounding areas. As spring arrives and the thawing process begins, Lake Saint Clair transforms. The increased water turbidity resulting from the snow and ice melting leads to the formation of stunning patterns, with swirls of blue and purple blending together in a hypnotic display. By analysing the data collected by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites, researchers can determine the concentration of suspended particles in water, which is a key indicator of its turbidity."
"water-shortage-netherlands"	"The list of European countries heavily afflicted by drought is getting longer. On 3 August, the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management officialised the water shortage condition in the country. The situation, which currently does not affect drinking water, will cause a redistribution of water to ensuring water supply to the dykes, the peat begs and very vulnerable natural areas. Another cause for concern is the level of the Rhine River. Measurements at the beginning of August in Lobith, a town on the German border, showed that the river is approaching its lowest flow level ever recorded. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 5 August 2021 (left) and 3 August 2022 (right), show the effects of water scarcity o the Rhine river, near Gendt in the Netherlands. Updated data on the ongoing drought conditions in Europe are published by the Copernicus EMS European Drought Observatory."
"water-turbidity-along-east-coast-spain"	"After exceptional snowfalls affected central and northern Spain — especially the Madrid region — moderate rains caused the fallen snow to rapidly melt which resulted in increased river flows. Finally, on 28 January, a heatwave hit the eastern part of Spain, with record temperatures for a month of January, over 29°C, being measured. For example, in Alicante 29.2°C were recorded. This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites on 28 January, shows swirls along the east coast of Spain coloured by suspended matter originating from increased river runoff, a phenomenon referred to as water turbidity by scientists. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is composed of two twin satellites, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, which allow us to monitor water quality and sediment transport in coastal areas."

"waters-averno-lake-italy-have-turned-red"	"Averno is a Lake in the Campania region in Southern Italy, close to Naples. It is known for its characteristic landscape and biodiversity and is one of the Natura2000 protected areas of the Regional Park of Campi Flegrei. Recently, its waters have turned red as a result of a massive algal bloom, as reported by local media. These images, acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 1 March 2022 (left) and 5 April 2022 (right), show the remarkable change of colour of the Averno Lake’s waters. Scientists who are currently monitoring the phenomenon believe that the dark-red colour is caused by an algal bloom in the lake and by the eutrophication of the lake water (that is, the accumulation of nutrients in bodies of water), which is influenced by weather conditions. This temporary change in colour occurs seasonally, and the Averno Lake should soon go back to normal. Data from Copernicus missions allow the detection and monitoring of different algal blooms and of lake water quality levels, which are essential for the protection of vulnerable environments and biodiversity sites."
"weser-river-estuary-and-bremerhaven-port-germany"	"This image, acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 8 November 2020, shows the port of Bremerhaven and the estuary of the river Weser in Germany.

"wetland-estuario-do-sado-portugal"	"Lead has been used in ammunition and fishing tackle for centuries, but only a small proportion of the lead fired hits its target. The remainder lands in the environment, where it can be mistaken for food by birds, leading to the poisoning of a wide range of species. Estimates indicate that every year, 21 to 27,000 tonnes of lead gunshot are being dispersed in European wetlands by hunting and sports shooting. At the end of October 2020, the European Parliament’s Environment Committee voted to ban the use of lead ammunition in wetlands across the EU: this regulation, according to the European Chemicals Agency, will help prevent the death of one million waterbirds from lead poisoning every year. This image acquired by one of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites on 20 November 2020 shows the wetland of Estuário do Sado in Portugal, one of the 1,011 Ramsar Sites in Europe which will benefit from this new EU regulation.
